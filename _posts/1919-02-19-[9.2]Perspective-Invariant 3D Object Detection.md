## Subfields
 3D Perception / Domain Adaptation (LiDAR)
## Reason for Interest

论文不仅提出了一个新的多平台（车辆、无人机、四足机器人）LiDAR 3D检测数据集Pi3DET，填补了非车辆自动驾驶平台数据的空白，还深入分析了不同平台间的几何差异（视角、运动稳定性等）。提出的Pi3DET-Net框架通过几何对齐（随机抖动、虚拟位姿）和特征对齐（KL概率对齐）有效解决了跨平台域适应问题。实验设计非常详尽，建立了包含18种主流检测器的Benchmark，对提升自动驾驶系统在不同传感器配置和安装视角下的泛化能力具有重要参考价值。
## Abstract: 
With the rise of robotics, LiDAR-based 3D object detection has garnered significant attention in both academia and industry. However, existing datasets and methods predominantly focus on vehicle-mounted platforms, leaving other autonomous platforms underexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce Pi3DET, the first benchmark featuring LiDAR data and 3D bounding box annotations collected from multiple platforms: vehicle, quadruped, and drone, thereby facilitating research in 3D object detection for non-vehicle platforms as well as cross-platform 3D detection. Based on Pi3DET, we propose a novel cross-platform adaptation framework that transfers knowledge from the well-studied vehicle platform to other platforms. This framework achieves perspective-invariant 3D detection through robust alignment at both geometric and feature levels. Additionally, we establish a benchmark to evaluate the resilience and robustness of current 3D detectors in cross-platform scenarios, providing valuable insights for developing adaptive 3D perception systems. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach on challenging cross-platform tasks, demonstrating substantial gains over existing adaptation methods. We hope this work paves the way for generalizable and unified 3D perception systems across diverse and complex environments. Our Pi3DET dataset, cross-platform benchmark suite, and annotation toolkit have been made publicly available.
