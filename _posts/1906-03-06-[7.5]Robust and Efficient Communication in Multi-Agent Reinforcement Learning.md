## Subfields
 多智能体强化学习 (MARL) / 车路协同 (V2X) / 协同感知
## Reason for Interest

这是一篇关于多智能体强化学习（MARL）中鲁棒与高效通信策略的综述论文。文章系统地分类了在通信受限（噪声、攻击、延迟、带宽限制）条件下的MARL方法，并专门探讨了其在协同自动驾驶（Cooperative Autonomous Driving）和分布式SLAM中的应用价值。对于从事V2X、车队协同控制以及多车协同感知领域的研究人员来说，该文提供了极具价值的文献梳理和技术路线图，指出了从理论模型向实际车端部署转化的关键挑战（如通信延迟、对抗攻击等）。虽然作为综述不涉及新算法的SOTA刷榜，但其对自动驾驶前沿方向（协同智能）的总结具有较高的参考意义。
## Abstract: 
Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has made significant strides in enabling coordinated behaviors among autonomous agents. However, most existing approaches assume that communication is instantaneous, reliable, and has unlimited bandwidth; these conditions are rarely met in real-world deployments. This survey systematically reviews recent advances in robust and efficient communication strategies for MARL under realistic constraints, including message perturbations, transmission delays, and limited bandwidth. Furthermore, because the challenges of low-latency reliability, bandwidth-intensive data sharing, and communication-privacy trade-offs are central to practical MARL systems, we focus on three applications involving cooperative autonomous driving, distributed simultaneous localization and mapping, and federated learning. Finally, we identify key open challenges and future research directions, advocating a unified approach that co-designs communication, learning, and robustness to bridge the gap between theoretical MARL models and practical implementations.
