## Subfields
 端到端自动驾驶 / 世界模型 (End-to-End AD / World Models)
## Reason for Interest

论文针对自动驾驶中极为关键的传感器故障和OOD噪声问题，提出了一种基于世界模型‘惊奇度’（Surprise，即KL散度）的动态传感器过滤与拒绝采样机制。该方法在理论上利用了世界模型的内在特性，无需额外的监督信号即可识别异常输入。实验部分在CARLA驾驶模拟器中进行了详尽的测试（包括眩光、遮挡、抖动等多种噪声），证明了该方法能显著提升端到端驾驶策略的鲁棒性。虽然主要是在仿真环境中验证，但对于提升基于学习的自动驾驶系统的安全性具有重要的参考价值和启发性。代码已开源，研究扎实。
## Abstract: 
AI systems deployed in the real world must contend with distractions and out-of-distribution (OOD) noise that can destabilize their policies and lead to unsafe behavior. While robust training can reduce sensitivity to some forms of noise, it is infeasible to anticipate all possible OOD conditions. To mitigate this issue, we develop an algorithm that leverages a world model's inherent measure of surprise to reduce the impact of noise in world model--based reinforcement learning agents. We introduce both multi-representation and single-representation rejection sampling, enabling robustness to settings with multiple faulty sensors or a single faulty sensor. While the introduction of noise typically degrades agent performance, we show that our techniques preserve performance relative to baselines under varying types and levels of noise across multiple environments within self-driving simulation domains (CARLA and Safety Gymnasium). Furthermore, we demonstrate that our methods enhance the stability of two state-of-the-art world models with markedly different underlying architectures: Cosmos and DreamerV3. Together, these results highlight the robustness of our approach across world modeling domains. We release our code at https://github.com/Bluefin-Tuna/WISER .
