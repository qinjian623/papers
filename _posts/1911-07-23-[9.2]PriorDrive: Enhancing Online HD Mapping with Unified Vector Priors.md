## Subfields
 在线高精地图构建 (Online HD Map Construction)
## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种名为PriorDrive的通用框架，旨在通过统一向量编码器（UVE）有效融合多种形式的先验地图数据（如SD地图、过时HD地图、历史轨迹预测），以增强在线高精地图构建的鲁棒性。其核心创新点包括：1）设计了针对向量数据的点级与段级掩码预训练策略，提升了模型对带噪先验的理解能力；2）提出了混合先验查询（HPQuery）机制，实现了先验特征与在线感知模型的无缝融合。实验表明，该方法在不显著增加推理成本的前提下，相比单纯依赖车端感知的基线模型（MapTRv2）有巨大提升（+14.3 mAP），且显著优于现有的栅格化先验融合方法，具有极高的工业落地潜力和研究价值。
## Abstract: 
High-Definition Maps (HD maps) are essential for the precise navigation and decision-making of autonomous vehicles, yet their creation and upkeep present significant cost and timeliness challenges. The online construction of HD maps using on-board sensors has emerged as a promising solution; however, these methods can be impeded by incomplete data due to occlusions and inclement weather, while their performance in distant regions remains unsatisfying. This paper proposes PriorDrive to address these limitations by directly harnessing the power of various vectorized prior maps, significantly enhancing the robustness and accuracy of online HD map construction. Our approach integrates a variety of prior maps uniformly, such as OpenStreetMap's Standard Definition Maps (SD maps), outdated HD maps from vendors, and locally constructed maps from historical vehicle data. To effectively integrate such prior information into online mapping models, we introduce a Hybrid Prior Representation (HPQuery) that standardizes the representation of diverse map elements. We further propose a Unified Vector Encoder (UVE), which employs fused prior embedding and a dual encoding mechanism to encode vector data. To improve the UVE's generalizability and performance, we propose a segment-level and point-level pre-training strategy that enables the UVE to learn the prior distribution of vector data. Through extensive testing on the nuScenes, Argoverse 2 and OpenLane-V2, we demonstrate that PriorDrive is highly compatible with various online mapping models and substantially improves map prediction capabilities. The integration of prior maps through PriorDrive offers a robust solution to the challenges of single-perception data, paving the way for more reliable autonomous vehicle navigation.
