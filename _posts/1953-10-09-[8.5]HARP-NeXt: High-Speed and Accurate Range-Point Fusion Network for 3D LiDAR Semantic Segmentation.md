## Subfields
 3D Perception / LiDAR Semantic Segmentation
## Reason for Interest

The paper presents a highly practical solution for real-time LiDAR segmentation, directly addressing the bottleneck of pre-processing on embedded systems (Jetson AGX Orin). While it does not beat the absolute accuracy SOTA (PTv3), the 24x speedup with only a 1.3% drop in accuracy represents a significant engineering contribution for deployed autonomous driving systems. The proposed GPU-based pre-processing and 'Conv-SE-NeXt' block are well-motivated and validated.
