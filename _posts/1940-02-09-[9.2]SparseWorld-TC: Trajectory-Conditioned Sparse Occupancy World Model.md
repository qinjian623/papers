## Subfields
 4D Occupancy Forecasting / World Model
## Reason for Interest

The paper presents a highly innovative 'SparseWorld' architecture that abandons the traditional VAE tokenization and dense BEV representations commonly used in occupancy world models. By utilizing sparse anchors and a pure attention mechanism, it not only achieves State-of-the-Art (SOTA) performance with a substantial margin (e.g., >18% improvement in mIoU over prior arts) but also improves inference efficiency (2x faster than I²-World). The inclusion of trajectory conditioning and validation on long-term forecasting (up to 8 seconds) demonstrates strong potential for downstream planning tasks. The collaboration between Li Auto and Tongji University, along with the release of code, ensures high credibility and industry relevance.
