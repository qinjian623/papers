## Subfields
 Visual Odometry / SLAM (Geometric Vision)
## Reason for Interest

The paper introduces a novel minimal solver for relative pose and focal length estimation by leveraging 2 Affine Correspondences (ACs) and IMU gravity constraints.

Pros:
1. **Theoretical Innovation**: The method effectively reduces the problem complexity by utilizing the vertical direction from IMU, allowing the system to be solved with only 2 ACs. This is theoretically elegant and beneficial for RANSAC efficiency (requiring fewer iterations).
2. **Performance**: Experimental results on KITTI and synthetic datasets demonstrate superior numerical stability and accuracy compared to existing solvers (e.g., Ding-4PC, Kuke-6PC). The reduction in translation and rotation errors is consistent.
3. **Practicality**: The integration of IMU data is a standard setup in autonomous driving, making the gravity-aligned assumption valid.

Cons:
1. **Application Scope**: The primary focus on 'unknown focal length' (online calibration) is slightly less critical for mature L4 autonomous driving systems where sensors are rigorously pre-calibrated. However, it remains valuable for system robustness, crowdsourced mapping, or 'wild' sensor setups.
2. **Dependency**: The method relies on the accurate extraction of Affine Correspondences, which can be more sensitive to noise than simple point matches, although the paper discusses deep learning-based mitigation.

Overall, it is a high-quality geometric vision paper with clear algorithmic contributions and solid validation.
## Abstract: 
In this paper, we aim to estimate the relative pose and focal length between two views with known intrinsic parameters except for an unknown focal length from two affine correspondences (ACs). Cameras are commonly used in combination with inertial measurement units (IMUs) in applications such as self-driving cars, smartphones, and unmanned aerial vehicles. The vertical direction of camera views can be obtained by IMU measurements. The relative pose between two cameras is reduced from 5DOF to 3DOF. We propose a new solver to estimate the 3DOF relative pose and focal length. First, we establish constraint equations from two affine correspondences when the vertical direction is known. Then, based on the properties of the equation system with nontrivial solutions, four equations can be derived. These four equations only involve two parameters: the focal length and the relative rotation angle. Finally, the polynomial eigenvalue method is utilized to solve the problem of focal length and relative rotation angle. The proposed solver is evaluated using synthetic and real-world datasets. The results show that our solver performs better than the existing state-of-the-art solvers.
