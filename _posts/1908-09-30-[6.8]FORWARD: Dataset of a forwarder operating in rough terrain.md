## Subfields
 越野自动驾驶 / 机器人感知数据集 (Off-road AD / Robotics Dataset)
## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一个针对林业场景的高分辨率多模态数据集（FORWARD），包含激光雷达、全景相机、IMU、RTK-GNSS以及车辆CAN总线（含燃油、起重机操作）和高精地形数据。1. 创新性与价值：该工作主要创新在于填补了特种重型车辆（铰接式）在非结构化复杂地形下感知与控制数据的空白，特别是结合了整车振动、土壤相互作用和作业循环数据，对越野自动驾驶的通过性预测（Traversability）和物理仿真建模有较高研究价值。2. 实验完整性：数据采集流程严谨，涵盖了不同载重、速度和地形配置，且提供了详细的传感器同步和后处理工具。3. 评分依据：尽管该数据集在特定细分领域（越野/林业）质量很高，但相对于主流的城市/高速自动驾驶研究，其应用场景较为小众，缺乏动态交通流等通用自动驾驶要素，因此在行业通用潜力上略有折损，综合给出6.8分。
## Abstract: 
We present FORWARD, a high-resolution multimodal dataset of a cut-to-length forwarder operating in rough terrain on two harvest sites in the middle part of Sweden. The forwarder is a large Komatsu model equipped with a variety of sensors, including RTK-GNSS, 360-camera, operator vibration sensors, internal CAN-bus signal recording, and multiple IMUs. The data includes event time logs recorded in 5 Hz with e.g., driving speed, fuel consumption, vehicle position with centimeter accuracy, and crane use while the vehicle operates in forest areas laser-scanned with very high-resolution, $\sim$1500 points per square meter. Production log files (StanForD standard) with time-stamped machine events, extensive video material, and terrain data in various formats are included as well. About 18 hours of regular wood extraction work during three days is annotated from 360-video material into individual work elements and included in the dataset. We also include scenario specifications of conducted experiments on forest roads and in terrain. Scenarios include repeatedly driving the same routes with and without steel tracks, different load weight, and different target driving speeds. The dataset is intended for developing models and algorithms for trafficability, perception, and autonomous control of forest machines using artificial intelligence, simulation, and experiments on physical testbeds. In part, we focus on forwarders traversing terrain, avoiding obstacles, and loading or unloading logs, with consideration for efficiency, fuel consumption, safety, and environmental impact. Other benefits of the open dataset include the ability to explore auto-generation and calibration of forestry machine simulators and automation scenario descriptions using the data recorded in the field.
