## Reason for Interest

该论文针对自动驾驶长尾问题中的关键场景（Critical Scenarios）挖掘提出了完整的工程链路。其核心价值在于：1. 融合了车端高精数据与空中俯瞰视角（Drone/Aerial）数据，并详细分析了航拍视角下的透视误差与修正方法，数据处理严谨；2. 提出了一种基于‘峰值准则’（Peak Criterion）的变道检测方法，有效解决了噪声数据下的场景提取问题；3. 实现了从真实数据提取到仿真（PTV Vissim）泛化生成的闭环，并通过测试‘裕度增加系统’（MIS）验证了方法的有效性。虽然不涉及新型深度学习架构的提出，但对于自动驾驶的安全验证与预期功能安全（SOTIF）具有很高的实用价值和参考意义。
## Abstract: 
The reliable operation of autonomous vehicles, automated driving functions, and advanced driver assistance systems across a wide range of relevant scenarios is critical for their development and deployment. Identifying a near-complete set of relevant driving scenarios for such functionalities is challenging due to numerous degrees of freedom involved, each affecting the outcomes of the driving scenario differently. Moreover, with increasing technical complexity of new functionalities, the number of potentially relevant, particularly "unknown unsafe" scenarios is increasing. To enhance validation efficiency, it is essential to identify relevant scenarios in advance, starting with simpler domains like highways before moving to more complex environments such as urban traffic. To address this, this paper focuses on analyzing lane change scenarios in highway traffic, which involve multiple degrees of freedom and present numerous safetyrelevant scenarios. We describe the process of data acquisition and processing of real-world data from public highway traffic, followed by the application of criticality measures on trajectory data to evaluate scenarios, as conducted within the AVEAS project (www.aveas.org). By linking the calculated measures to specific lane change driving scenarios and the conditions under which the data was collected, we facilitate the identification of safetyrelevant driving scenarios for various applications. Further, to tackle the extensive range of "unknown unsafe" scenarios, we propose a way to generate relevant scenarios by creating synthetic scenarios based on recorded ones. Consequently, we demonstrate and evaluate a processing chain that enables the identification of safety-relevant scenarios, the development of data-driven methods for extracting these scenarios, and the generation of synthetic critical scenarios via sampling on highways.
