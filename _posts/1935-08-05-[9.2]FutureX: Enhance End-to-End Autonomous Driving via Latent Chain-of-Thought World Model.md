## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种极具创新性的端到端自动驾驶框架FutureX，核心在于引入了‘潜在思维链（Latent Chain-of-Thought）’和‘自动思考开关（Auto-think Switch）’。1. **创新性强**：将大模型中的思维链（CoT）概念引入驾驶世界模型，通过在潜在空间进行多步未来推演来优化决策，并模仿人类‘快慢系统’（System 1/2）动态决定是否开启推理模式，逻辑自洽且符合行业发展趋势。2. **实验扎实**：在数据驱动的NAVSIM和闭环仿真CARLA双平台上进行了广泛验证，对比了LTF、TransFuser、UniAD等强基线，且消融实验详细（分析了推理步数、延迟等）。3. **效果显著**：在安全性（碰撞率大幅降低）和规划质量（PDMS显著提升）上均展示了SOTA级别的性能，且推理延迟增加在可接受范围内（Auto模式平衡了效率）。具有极高的研究价值和落地潜力。
## Abstract: 
In autonomous driving, end-to-end planners learn scene representations from raw sensor data and utilize them to generate a motion plan or control actions. However, exclusive reliance on the current scene for motion planning may result in suboptimal responses in highly dynamic traffic environments where ego actions further alter the future scene. To model the evolution of future scenes, we leverage the World Model to represent how the ego vehicle and its environment interact and change over time, which entails complex reasoning. The Chain of Thought (CoT) offers a promising solution by forecasting a sequence of future thoughts that subsequently guide trajectory refinement. In this paper, we propose FutureX, a CoT-driven pipeline that enhances end-to-end planners to perform complex motion planning via future scene latent reasoning and trajectory refinement. Specifically, the Auto-think Switch examines the current scene and decides whether additional reasoning is required to yield a higher-quality motion plan. Once FutureX enters the Thinking mode, the Latent World Model conducts a CoT-guided rollout to predict future scene representation, enabling the Summarizer Module to further refine the motion plan. Otherwise, FutureX operates in an Instant mode to generate motion plans in a forward pass for relatively simple scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FutureX enhances existing methods by producing more rational motion plans and fewer collisions without compromising efficiency, thereby achieving substantial overall performance gains, e.g., 6.2 PDMS improvement for TransFuser on NAVSIM. Code will be released.
