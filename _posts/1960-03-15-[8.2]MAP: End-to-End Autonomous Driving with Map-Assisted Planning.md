## Subfields
 End-to-End Autonomous Driving / V2X Planning
## Reason for Interest

The paper proposes a 'Map-Assisted Planning' (MAP) framework that addresses the underutilization of online mapping in end-to-end driving. By decoupling the planning queries into map-enhancing and ego-status-guided streams and fusing them via a learnable adapter, it achieves significant improvements in trajectory accuracy (L2 error) and lane compliance (off-road rate). The approach is validated by winning a CVPR 2025 workshop challenge. However, the removal of heavy perception modules (tracking, occupancy) to improve efficiency resulted in a slightly degraded Collision Rate compared to the strongest baselines, preventing a higher score.
