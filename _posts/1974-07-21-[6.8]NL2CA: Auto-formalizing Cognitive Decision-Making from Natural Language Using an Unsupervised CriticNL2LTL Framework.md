## Subfields
 自动驾驶仿真 / 行为建模 (Simulation / Behavior Modeling)
## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种新颖的Neuro-Symbolic方法，通过LLM和LTL自动化生成可解释的认知驾驶规则。这对于解决大模型幻觉和提升仿真NPC的拟人化程度具有较高学术价值。然而，该评分受限于以下因素：1. 严重依赖Ground Truth符号化状态输入，脱离了车端感知噪声的现实挑战，工程落地难度大；2. 实验场景较为基础，且未与行业主流的强规划基线（如基于优化的方法或SOTA端到端模型）进行性能对比；3. 核心贡献更偏向于认知科学与AI的结合，而非直接提升自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性或安全性。
## Abstract: 
Cognitive computing models offer a formal and interpretable way to characterize human's deliberation and decision-making, yet their development remains labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose NL2CA, a novel method for auto-formalizing cognitive decision-making rules from natural language descriptions of human experience. Different from most related work that exploits either pure manual or human guided interactive modeling, our method is fully automated without any human intervention. The approach first translates text into Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) using a fine-tuned large language model (LLM), then refines the logic via an unsupervised Critic Tree, and finally transforms the output into executable production rules compatible with symbolic cognitive frameworks. Based on the resulted rules, a cognitive agent is further constructed and optimized through cognitive reinforcement learning according to the real-world behavioral data. Our method is validated in two domains: (1) NL-to-LTL translation, where our CriticNL2LTL module achieves consistent performance across both expert and large-scale benchmarks without human-in-the-loop feed-backs, and (2) cognitive driving simulation, where agents automatically constructed from human interviews have successfully learned the diverse decision patterns of about 70 trials in different critical scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that NL2CA enables scalable, interpretable, and human-aligned cognitive modeling from unstructured textual data, offering a novel paradigm to automatically design symbolic cognitive agents.
