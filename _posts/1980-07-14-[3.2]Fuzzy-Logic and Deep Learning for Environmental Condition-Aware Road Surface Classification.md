## Subfields
 感知 / 路面状态分类
## Reason for Interest

1. 技术滞后：在2024年的语境下，仍将AlexNet和VGG作为最佳模型推荐，未涉及任何现代轻量化或高性能架构，创新性极低。
2. 实验薄弱：完全依赖小规模私有数据集，缺乏公开数据集的Benchmark对比，实验结论的可信度和泛化性不足。
3. 方案定位：基于手机传感器的方案更偏向于低成本ITS应用，而非严格的车端自动驾驶感知系统。
4. 融合简单：模糊逻辑仅作为简单的规则切换器，而非深度的特征融合，技术深度不足。
## Abstract: 
Monitoring states of road surfaces provides valuable information for the planning and controlling vehicles and active vehicle control systems. Classical road monitoring methods are expensive and unsystematic because they require time for measurements. This article proposes an real time system based on weather conditional data and road surface condition data. For this purpose, we collected data with a mobile phone camera on the roads around the campus of the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. We tested a large number of different image-based deep learning algorithms for road classification. In addition, we used road acceleration data along with road image data for training by using them as images. We compared the performances of acceleration-based and camera image-based approaches. The performances of the simple Alexnet, LeNet, VGG, and Resnet algorithms were compared as deep learning algorithms. For road condition classification, 5 classes were considered: asphalt, damaged asphalt, gravel road, damaged gravel road, pavement road and over 95% accuracy performance was achieved. It is also proposed to use the acceleration or the camera image to classify the road surface according to the weather and the time of day using fuzzy logic.
