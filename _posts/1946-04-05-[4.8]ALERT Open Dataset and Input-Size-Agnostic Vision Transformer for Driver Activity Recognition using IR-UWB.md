## Subfields
 智能座舱 / 驾驶员监控 (DMS)
## Reason for Interest

1. 选题方向：论文聚焦于基于 IR-UWB 雷达的驾驶员行为识别，属于智能座舱与 DMS 范畴。虽对 L2/L3 级人机共驾安全有意义，但不属于自动驾驶核心的‘感知-规划-控制’闭环技术，根据评分规则上限受限。
2. 创新性：主要贡献是发布了包含实车环境多径干扰的 UWB 数据集（ALERT），并提出 ISA-ViT 解决雷达信号图谱尺寸与 ViT 预训练位置编码不匹配的问题。方法论上的创新主要在于输入适配和通过频域/距离域融合来提升分类效果，技术深度中等。
3. 实验完整性：实验对比了 CNN、RNN 和 Transformer 基线，消融实验较为详尽（如观测窗口、Few-shot 设置等），结果可信度尚可。
4. 综合评价：作为一篇应用型论文，解决了具体落地问题（ViT 在非图像尺寸信号上的应用），但由于偏离自动驾驶核心算法赛道，且 UWB 并非主流自动驾驶感知传感器，行业通用性有限。
## Abstract: 
Distracted driving contributes to fatal crashes worldwide. To address this, researchers are using driver activity recognition (DAR) with impulse radio ultra-wideband (IR-UWB) radar, which offers advantages such as interference resistance, low power consumption, and privacy preservation. However, two challenges limit its adoption: the lack of large-scale real-world UWB datasets covering diverse distracted driving behaviors, and the difficulty of adapting fixed-input Vision Transformers (ViTs) to UWB radar data with non-standard dimensions.
  This work addresses both challenges. We present the ALERT dataset, which contains 10,220 radar samples of seven distracted driving activities collected in real driving conditions. We also propose the input-size-agnostic Vision Transformer (ISA-ViT), a framework designed for radar-based DAR. The proposed method resizes UWB data to meet ViT input requirements while preserving radar-specific information such as Doppler shifts and phase characteristics. By adjusting patch configurations and leveraging pre-trained positional embedding vectors (PEVs), ISA-ViT overcomes the limitations of naive resizing approaches. In addition, a domain fusion strategy combines range- and frequency-domain features to further improve classification performance.
  Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ISA-ViT achieves a 22.68% accuracy improvement over an existing ViT-based approach for UWB-based DAR. By publicly releasing the ALERT dataset and detailing our input-size-agnostic strategy, this work facilitates the development of more robust and scalable distracted driving detection systems for real-world deployment.
