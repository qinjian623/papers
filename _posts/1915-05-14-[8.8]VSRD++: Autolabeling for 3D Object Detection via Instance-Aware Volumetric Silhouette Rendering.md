## Subfields
 弱监督3D目标检测 / 自动标注 (Weakly Supervised 3D Object Detection / Autolabeling)
## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种利用2D实例分割掩码进行3D目标自动标注的框架VSRD++，旨在解决自动驾驶中3D标注成本高昂的问题。其核心创新在于：1）将实例SDF分解为Cuboid SDF和残差场（RDF），在保持3D框约束的同时拟合精细形状；2）引入速度属性和时变SDF建模，有效解决了NeRF类方法在动态物体上的重建难题；3）利用自监督深度估计进行3D属性初始化，提高了优化稳定性。实验表明，该方法生成的伪标签质量足以训练高性能的单目3D检测器（如MonoFlex、MonoDETR），甚至在某些指标上接近全监督水平。虽然自动标注阶段利用了双目图像进行初始化，但显著降低了对人工3D标注和LiDAR点云的依赖，对自动驾驶数据闭环具有较高的实用价值。
## Abstract: 
Monocular 3D object detection is a fundamental yet challenging task in 3D scene understanding. Existing approaches heavily depend on supervised learning with extensive 3D annotations, which are often acquired from LiDAR point clouds through labor-intensive labeling processes. To tackle this problem, we propose VSRD++, a novel weakly supervised framework for monocular 3D object detection that eliminates the reliance on 3D annotations and leverages neural-field-based volumetric rendering with weak 2D supervision. VSRD++ consists of a two-stage pipeline: multi-view 3D autolabeling and subsequent monocular 3D detector training. In the multi-view autolabeling stage, object surfaces are represented as signed distance fields (SDFs) and rendered as instance masks via the proposed instance-aware volumetric silhouette rendering. To optimize 3D bounding boxes, we decompose each instance's SDF into a cuboid SDF and a residual distance field (RDF) that captures deviations from the cuboid. To address the geometry inconsistency commonly observed in volume rendering methods applied to dynamic objects, we model the dynamic objects by including velocity into bounding box attributes as well as assigning confidence to each pseudo-label. Moreover, we also employ a 3D attribute initialization module to initialize the dynamic bounding box parameters. In the monocular 3D object detection phase, the optimized 3D bounding boxes serve as pseudo labels for training monocular 3D object detectors. Extensive experiments on the KITTI-360 dataset demonstrate that VSRD++ significantly outperforms existing weakly supervised approaches for monocular 3D object detection on both static and dynamic scenes.
