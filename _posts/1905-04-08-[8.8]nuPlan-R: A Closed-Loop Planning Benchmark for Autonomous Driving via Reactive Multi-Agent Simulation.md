## Reason for Interest

论文针对当前主流nuPlan基准中背景车辆（IDM）行为僵化、交互不真实的问题，提出了nuPlan-R。创新点在于：1）利用去噪解耦的扩散模型替代规则型IDM，生成更类人的反应式交互行为；2）引入交互感知筛选机制，平衡计算效率与真实度；3）提出了SR和PR等补充指标。实验不仅证明了仿真代理的SOTA级真实性，还通过重测主流规划器（如PDM, UrbanDriver等），揭示了原有基准可能导致规则型规划器性能虚高的问题。该工作对于提升自动驾驶闭环评估的可信度具有重要价值。
## Abstract: 
Recent advances in closed-loop planning benchmarks have significantly improved the evaluation of autonomous vehicles. However, existing benchmarks still rely on rule-based reactive agents such as the Intelligent Driver Model (IDM), which lack behavioral diversity and fail to capture realistic human interactions, leading to oversimplified traffic dynamics. To address these limitations, we present nuPlan-R, a new reactive closed-loop planning benchmark that integrates learning-based reactive multi-agent simulation into the nuPlan framework. Our benchmark replaces the rule-based IDM agents with noise-decoupled diffusion-based reactive agents and introduces an interaction-aware agent selection mechanism to ensure both realism and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we extend the benchmark with two additional metrics to enable a more comprehensive assessment of planning performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our reactive agent model produces more realistic, diverse, and human-like traffic behaviors, leading to a benchmark environment that better reflects real-world interactive driving. We further reimplement a collection of rule-based, learning-based, and hybrid planning approaches within our nuPlan-R benchmark, providing a clearer reflection of planner performance in complex interactive scenarios and better highlighting the advantages of learning-based planners in handling complex and dynamic scenarios. These results establish nuPlan-R as a new standard for fair, reactive, and realistic closed-loop planning evaluation. We will open-source the code for the new benchmark.
