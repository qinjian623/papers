## Reason for Interest

该论文针对自动驾驶感知评价中'传统指标（mAP等）无法反映安全性'这一核心痛点，进行了深入的工程分析。优点在于：1. 提供了对现有物理临界指标（RSS, TTC, SACRED等）的全面综述和基准测试；2. 提出的双向评级和聚合策略逻辑清晰，有效解决了单一物理指标在不同场景下漏检的问题，显著提升了危险对象识别的召回率；3. 选题紧贴行业落地需求（安全验证）。缺点在于：1. 实验基于DeepAccident（CARLA仿真数据集），物理指标高度依赖准确的速度/加速度真值，论文未深入讨论真实世界传感器噪声对这些微分指标鲁棒性的影响；2. 创新点主要在于规则的组合与应用策略，缺乏底层理论或算法层面的突破。总体而言，是一篇对自动驾驶测试验证具有较高实用价值的参考论文。
## Abstract: 
Ensuring safety is the primary objective of automated driving, which necessitates a comprehensive and accurate perception of the environment. While numerous performance evaluation metrics exist for assessing perception capabilities, incorporating safety-specific metrics is essential to reliably evaluate object detection systems. A key component for safety evaluation is the ability to distinguish between relevant and non-relevant objects - a challenge addressed by criticality or relevance metrics. This paper presents the first in-depth analysis of criticality metrics for safety evaluation of object detection systems. Through a comprehensive review of existing literature, we identify and assess a range of applicable metrics. Their effectiveness is empirically validated using the DeepAccident dataset, which features a variety of safety-critical scenarios. To enhance evaluation accuracy, we propose two novel application strategies: bidirectional criticality rating and multi-metric aggregation. Our approach demonstrates up to a 100% improvement in terms of criticality classification accuracy, highlighting its potential to significantly advance the safety evaluation of object detection systems in automated vehicles.
