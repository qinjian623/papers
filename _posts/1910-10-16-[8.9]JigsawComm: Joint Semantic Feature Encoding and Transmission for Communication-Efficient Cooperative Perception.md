## Subfields
 V2X 协同感知 (Cooperative Perception) / 多智能体特征融合
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性：提出了一种全新的“拼图式”协同感知框架（JigsawComm），通过联合训练稀疏语义编码器和基于效用的传输调度器，实现了O(1)的通信开销扩展性（即通信量不随智能体数量线性增加）。
2. 理论价值：揭示了现有融合算法中“更多数据反而可能降低精度”的现象（Redundancy Degradation），并从理论上证明了在特定效用定义下，每个空间网格仅选择Top-1智能体特征传输是也是最优策略。
3. 实用性与结果：在仿真（OPV2V）和真实（DAIR-V2X）数据集上均取得了极高的压缩效率（>100x），解决了V2X带宽受限的痛点，且代码已开源，具有很高的落地参考价值。
4. 实验完整：不仅对比了传统的压缩方法和选择方法，还进行了详细的消融实验验证了稀疏编码和调度策略的有效性。
## Abstract: 
Multi-agent cooperative perception (CP) promises to overcome the inherent occlusion and sensing-range limitations of single-agent systems (e.g., autonomous driving). However, its practicality is severely constrained by the limited communication bandwidth. Existing approaches attempt to improve bandwidth efficiency via compression or heuristic message selection, without considering the semantic relevance or cross-agent redundancy of sensory data. We argue that a practical CP system must maximize the contribution of every transmitted bit to the final perception task, by extracting and transmitting semantically essential and non-redundant data. In this paper, we formulate a joint semantic feature encoding and transmission problem, which aims to maximize CP accuracy under limited bandwidth. To solve this problem, we introduce JigsawComm, an end-to-end trained, semantic-aware, and communication-efficient CP framework that learns to ``assemble the puzzle'' of multi-agent feature transmission. It uses a regularized encoder to extract semantically-relevant and sparse features, and a lightweight Feature Utility Estimator to predict the contribution of each agent's features to the final perception task. The resulting meta utility maps are exchanged among agents and leveraged to compute a provably optimal transmission policy, which selects features from agents with the highest utility score for each location. This policy inherently eliminates redundancy and achieves a scalable $\mathcal{O}(1)$ communication cost as the number of agents increases. On the benchmarks OPV2V and DAIR-V2X, JigsawComm reduces the total data volume by up to $>$500$\times$ while achieving matching or superior accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.
