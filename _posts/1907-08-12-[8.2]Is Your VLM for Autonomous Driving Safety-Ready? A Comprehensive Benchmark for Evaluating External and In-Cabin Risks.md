## Subfields
 自动驾驶大模型 / 安全性评测 (VLM for AD / Safety Evaluation)
## Reason for Interest

论文填补了自动驾驶VLM评测中的一个重要空白，即同时考量外部环境风险与舱内驾驶员状态（如分心、疲劳）的综合安全性。创新性在于提出了‘舱内+舱外’联合分析的分类体系（10大类、28子类）；实验完整度较高，整合了10+个公开数据集并进行了清洗和专家标注；虽然SOTA是在自建数据集上取得的，属于‘提出基准并微调模型’的标准范式，但其对安全性的细粒度分析和构建的数据集对行业研发端到端/VLM驾驶系统具有较高的实用价值和指导意义。
## Abstract: 
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) show great promise for autonomous driving, but their suitability for safety-critical scenarios is largely unexplored, raising safety concerns. This issue arises from the lack of comprehensive benchmarks that assess both external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety simultaneously. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce DSBench, the first comprehensive Driving Safety Benchmark designed to assess a VLM's awareness of various safety risks in a unified manner. DSBench encompasses two major categories: external environmental risks and in-cabin driving behavior safety, divided into 10 key categories and a total of 28 sub-categories. This comprehensive evaluation covers a wide range of scenarios, ensuring a thorough assessment of VLMs' performance in safety-critical contexts. Extensive evaluations across various mainstream open-source and closed-source VLMs reveal significant performance degradation under complex safety-critical situations, highlighting urgent safety concerns. To address this, we constructed a large dataset of 98K instances focused on in-cabin and external safety scenarios, showing that fine-tuning on this dataset significantly enhances the safety performance of existing VLMs and paves the way for advancing autonomous driving technology. The benchmark toolkit, code, and model checkpoints will be publicly accessible.
