## Reason for Interest

该论文是 2024 CommonRoad 运动规划竞赛的总结报告，具有较高的行业参考价值。获胜方案（TUM-2024）创新性地将基于 Frenet 坐标系的采样规划器与 Level-k 博弈论交互模型相结合，有效提升了在无信控路口等复杂交互场景下的规划成功率（SOTA 级别的鲁棒性）。虽然实验表明其在轨迹平滑度和舒适性（Cost）上略逊于基于优化的方法（如 SB-2023），但其架构展示了优秀的工程实践和对动态交互的有效处理。论文提供了详实的对比分析，揭示了当前规划算法在广度（覆盖率）与深度（求解质量）之间的 Trade-off。
## Abstract: 
Over the past decade, a wide range of motion planning approaches for autonomous vehicles has been developed to handle increasingly complex traffic scenarios. However, these approaches are rarely compared on standardized benchmarks, limiting the assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses. To address this gap, we present the setup and results of the 4th CommonRoad Motion Planning Competition held in 2024, conducted using the CommonRoad benchmark suite. This annual competition provides an open-source and reproducible framework for benchmarking motion planning algorithms. The benchmark scenarios span highway and urban environments with diverse traffic participants, including passenger cars, buses, and bicycles. Planner performance is evaluated along four dimensions: efficiency, safety, comfort, and compliance with selected traffic rules. This report introduces the competition format and provides a comparison of representative high-performing planners from the 2023 and 2024 editions.
