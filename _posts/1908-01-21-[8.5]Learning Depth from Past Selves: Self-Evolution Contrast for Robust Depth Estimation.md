## Subfields
 单目深度估计 / 自监督学习 (Monocular Depth Estimation / Self-Supervised Learning)
## Reason for Interest

论文针对自动驾驶中恶劣天气（雨、雾、雪）导致深度估计失效的痛点，提出了一种新颖的'自演化对比学习'（SEC-Depth）框架。其核心创新在于利用训练过程中自然产生的历史模型（latency models）作为负样本生成器，避免了复杂的课程学习或额外模型蒸馏。这种方法即插即用，无需修改基线模型结构，且不依赖特定数据集的先验。实验部分非常扎实，不仅在合成数据集上验证了有效性，更在多个真实世界数据集上展示了卓越的零样本泛化能力，具有较高的行业应用潜力和学术价值。
## Abstract: 
Self-supervised depth estimation has gained significant attention in autonomous driving and robotics. However, existing methods exhibit substantial performance degradation under adverse weather conditions such as rain and fog, where reduced visibility critically impairs depth prediction. To address this issue, we propose a novel self-evolution contrastive learning framework called SEC-Depth for self-supervised robust depth estimation tasks. Our approach leverages intermediate parameters generated during training to construct temporally evolving latency models. Using these, we design a self-evolution contrastive scheme to mitigate performance loss under challenging conditions. Concretely, we first design a dynamic update strategy of latency models for the depth estimation task to capture optimization states across training stages. To effectively leverage latency models, we introduce a self-evolution contrastive Loss (SECL) that treats outputs from historical latency models as negative samples. This mechanism adaptively adjusts learning objectives while implicitly sensing weather degradation severity, reducing the needs for manual intervention. Experiments show that our method integrates seamlessly into diverse baseline models and significantly enhances robustness in zero-shot evaluations.
