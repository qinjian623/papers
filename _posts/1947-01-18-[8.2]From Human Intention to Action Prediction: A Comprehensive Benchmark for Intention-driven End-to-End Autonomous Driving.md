## Subfields
 端到端自动驾驶 / 驾驶意图理解 / 评测基准
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性强：论文敏锐地指出了当前端到端自动驾驶主要停留在'指令跟随'（如左转/右转）层面，缺乏对高层抽象人类意图（如'在右侧建筑旁停车'）的理解，并提出了新的任务范式。2. 基准建设：构建了 Intention-Drive 数据集和分层语言标注流程，填补了该领域的评估空白。3. 评价指标科学：提出了 Intent Success Rate (ISR) 指标，试图从语义层面而非仅从几何层面评估驾驶质量，这对提升自动驾驶的交互能力至关重要。4. 实验洞察：通过实验揭示了当前 SOTA 大模型（如 InternVL3.0）虽然驾驶轨迹平滑（低 ADE），但在理解复杂意图方面存在巨大缺陷（低 ISR），为行业指明了改进方向。扣分点在于评估过程中依赖 VLM 进行语义判别，其自身的准确性和鲁棒性可能引入评估噪声。
## Abstract: 
Current end-to-end autonomous driving systems operate at a level of intelligence akin to following simple steering commands. However, achieving genuinely intelligent autonomy requires a paradigm shift: moving from merely executing low-level instructions to understanding and fulfilling high-level, abstract human intentions. This leap from a command-follower to an intention-fulfiller, as illustrated in our conceptual framework, is hindered by a fundamental challenge: the absence of a standardized benchmark to measure and drive progress on this complex task. To address this critical gap, we introduce Intention-Drive, the first comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate the ability to translate high-level human intent into safe and precise driving actions. Intention-Drive features two core contributions: (1) a new dataset of complex scenarios paired with corresponding natural language intentions, and (2) a novel evaluation protocol centered on the Intent Success Rate (ISR), which assesses the semantic fulfillment of the human's goal beyond simple geometric accuracy. Through an extensive evaluation of a spectrum of baseline models on Intention-Drive, we reveal a significant performance deficit, showing that the baseline model struggle to achieve the comprehensive scene and intention understanding required for this advanced task.
