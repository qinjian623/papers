## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种结合RoI级时序立体匹配（Temporal Stereo）与稀疏Query检测的创新框架（StereoMV2D）。主要亮点在于：1）通过在2D RoI区域内构建轻量级Cost Volume，有效利用了时序几何约束解决单目深度模糊问题，同时避免了全图稠密匹配的高计算开销；2）设计了动态置信度门控机制，自适应融合单目与立体匹配特征，增强了对遮挡和动态物体的鲁棒性；3）实验结果扎实，在nuScenes和Argoverse 2双数据集上取得了SOTA级别的性能，且相比纯稀疏方法（如MV2D）有显著提升，相比稠密方法（如BEVStereo）在保持精度的同时具有计算优势。虽然依赖高精度2D检测器对推理速度有一定影响，但整体架构设计合理，具有较高的落地潜力和学术价值。
## Abstract: 
Multi-view 3D object detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving perception, where achieving a balance between detection accuracy and computational efficiency remains crucial. Sparse query-based 3D detectors efficiently aggregate object-relevant features from multi-view images through a set of learnable queries, offering a concise and end-to-end detection paradigm. Building on this foundation, MV2D leverages 2D detection results to provide high-quality object priors for query initialization, enabling higher precision and recall. However, the inherent depth ambiguity in single-frame 2D detections still limits the accuracy of 3D query generation. To address this issue, we propose StereoMV2D, a unified framework that integrates temporal stereo modeling into the 2D detection-guided multi-view 3D detector. By exploiting cross-temporal disparities of the same object across adjacent frames, StereoMV2D enhances depth perception and refines the query priors, while performing all computations efficiently within 2D regions of interest (RoIs). Furthermore, a dynamic confidence gating mechanism adaptively evaluates the reliability of temporal stereo cues through learning statistical patterns derived from the inter-frame matching matrix together with appearance consistency, ensuring robust detection under object appearance and occlusion. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Argoverse 2 datasets demonstrate that StereoMV2D achieves superior detection performance without incurring significant computational overhead.
