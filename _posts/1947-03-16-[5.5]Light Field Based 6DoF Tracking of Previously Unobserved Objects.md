## Subfields
 3D感知 / 6DoF目标跟踪 (3D Perception / Object Tracking)
## Reason for Interest

【创新性】论文创新性地结合了光场相机（Light Field）与高斯溅射（3DGS）进行无模型（Model-free）目标跟踪，利用光场的多视角特性有效解决了传统RGB-D相机难以处理的高反光物体（如金属车身、玻璃）的跟踪问题，技术路径新颖。

【实验与落地】然而，实验验证主要基于实验室环境的日常物品（如水壶、盒子）和Blender合成的“玩具车（Toy Car）”序列，完全缺乏真实自动驾驶场景（如车端采集的nuScenes或Waymo数据）的验证，导致其在真实道路环境下的有效性存疑。

【行业价值】光场相机目前并非自动驾驶量产车的主流传感器，其计算负载（文中提及需逐帧处理光场）和硬件成本限制了其落地潜力。尽管针对“反光物体”的解决思路对自动驾驶感知有启发意义，但由于缺乏车端真实数据支持且依赖非标传感器，其实际工程应用价值目前较低。综合考虑，给予5.5分。
## Abstract: 
Object tracking is an important step in robotics and reautonomous driving pipelines, which has to generalize to previously unseen and complex objects. Existing high-performing methods often rely on pre-captured object views to build explicit reference models, which restricts them to a fixed set of known objects. However, such reference models can struggle with visually complex appearance, reducing the quality of tracking. In this work, we introduce an object tracking method based on light field images that does not depend on a pre-trained model, while being robust to complex visual behavior, such as reflections. We extract semantic and geometric features from light field inputs using vision foundation models and convert them into view-dependent Gaussian splats. These splats serve as a unified object representation, supporting differentiable rendering and pose optimization. We further introduce a light field object tracking dataset containing challenging reflective objects with precise ground truth poses. Experiments demonstrate that our method is competitive with state-of-the-art model-based trackers in these difficult cases, paving the way toward universal object tracking in robotic systems.
