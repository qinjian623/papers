## Subfields
 单目3D目标检测 (Monocular 3D Object Detection)
## Reason for Interest

论文切入点具体且有效，针对单目3D检测中3D包围框投影至2D图像后形成不规则凸多边形的问题，提出了一种完全可微的Polygon IoU (PIoU) Loss。1. 创新性：将多边形IoU计算的可微化并批量实现，解决了传统L1 Loss无法直接优化几何重叠度的问题，思路清晰，数学推导合理。2. 实验完整性：在RTM3D、MonoCon、MonoRCNN三种不同架构的viewpoint-agnostic模型上进行了验证，并对比了L1 Loss，提供了详细的消融实验和收敛速度分析。3. 结果可信度：代码开源（虽文中未直接给链接但在引用中提及非官方实现），数据基于权威KITTI榜单，提升效果在MonoCon等模型上较为显著。4. 行业潜力：该方法作为一种插件式的损失函数，可以容易地集成到其他基于关键点回归的单目3D检测网络中，具有较好的工程应用价值。扣分点在于对部分模型（如RTM3D）的提升幅度较小，且主要局限于单目视觉方案。
## Abstract: 
Monocular 3D object detection is a challenging task because depth information is difficult to obtain from 2D images. A subset of viewpoint-agnostic monocular 3D detection methods also do not explicitly leverage scene homography or geometry during training, meaning that a model trained thusly can detect objects in images from arbitrary viewpoints. Such works predict the projections of the 3D bounding boxes on the image plane to estimate the location of the 3D boxes, but these projections are not rectangular so the calculation of IoU between these projected polygons is not straightforward. This work proposes an efficient, fully differentiable algorithm for the calculation of IoU between two convex polygons, which can be utilized to compute the IoU between two 3D bounding box footprints viewed from an arbitrary angle. We test the performance of the proposed polygon IoU loss (PIoU loss) on three state-of-the-art viewpoint-agnostic 3D detection models. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed PIoU loss converges faster than L1 loss and that in 3D detection models, a combination of PIoU loss and L1 loss gives better results than L1 loss alone (+1.64% AP70 for MonoCon on cars, +0.18% AP70 for RTM3D on cars, and +0.83%/+2.46% AP50/AP25 for MonoRCNN on cyclists).
