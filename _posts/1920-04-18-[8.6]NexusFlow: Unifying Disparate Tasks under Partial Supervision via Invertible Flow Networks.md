## Subfields
 多任务感知 (Multi-Task Perception) / 弱监督学习 (Weakly Supervised Learning)
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性与价值：论文解决了一个自动驾驶工业界极具痛点的实际问题——如何在标注不全且存在域差异（如不同城市）的数据集上联合训练多任务模型。提出的NexusFlow利用可逆流网络（Invertible Flow Networks）在特征空间进行对齐，既解决了稀疏任务（跟踪）与稠密任务（建图）的结构差异问题，又利用可逆性避免了特征坍塌，保留了信息量。 
2. 实验效果：在极具挑战的nuScenes地域分割设定下（波士顿有地图标注、新加坡有跟踪标注），不仅显著超越基线，甚至在部分指标上优于全监督Oracle模型，表明其特征对齐具有很强的泛化和正则化作用。 
3. 行业潜力：该方法允许利用碎片化的单一任务数据集训练统一大模型，能极大地降低自动驾驶数据标注成本，基于UniAD架构的验证也保证了其在端到端主流方案中的适用性。
## Abstract: 
Partially Supervised Multi-Task Learning (PS-MTL) aims to leverage knowledge across tasks when annotations are incomplete. Existing approaches, however, have largely focused on the simpler setting of homogeneous, dense prediction tasks, leaving the more realistic challenge of learning from structurally diverse tasks unexplored. To this end, we introduce NexusFlow, a novel, lightweight, and plug-and-play framework effective in both settings. NexusFlow introduces a set of surrogate networks with invertible coupling layers to align the latent feature distributions of tasks, creating a unified representation that enables effective knowledge transfer. The coupling layers are bijective, preserving information while mapping features into a shared canonical space. This invertibility avoids representational collapse and enables alignment across structurally different tasks without reducing expressive capacity. We first evaluate NexusFlow on the core challenge of domain-partitioned autonomous driving, where dense map reconstruction and sparse multi-object tracking are supervised in different geographic regions, creating both structural disparity and a strong domain gap. NexusFlow sets a new state-of-the-art result on nuScenes, outperforming strong partially supervised baselines. To demonstrate generality, we further test NexusFlow on NYUv2 using three homogeneous dense prediction tasks, segmentation, depth, and surface normals, as a representative N-task PS-MTL scenario. NexusFlow yields consistent gains across all tasks, confirming its broad applicability.
