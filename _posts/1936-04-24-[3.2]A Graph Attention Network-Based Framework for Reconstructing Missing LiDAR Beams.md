## Reason for Interest

The paper presents a method with a fatal flaw for autonomous driving: an inference time of 14.65 seconds per frame is orders of magnitude too slow for real-time application (typically <0.1s). Furthermore, the evaluation is conducted on a trivial amount of data (1,065 frames) with simplistic synthetic noise, lacking the rigor of standard benchmarks (e.g., full KITTI/nuScenes val sets). While the GAT approach is methodologically sound for geometry, the lack of efficiency and scale makes it practically invalid for the industry.
