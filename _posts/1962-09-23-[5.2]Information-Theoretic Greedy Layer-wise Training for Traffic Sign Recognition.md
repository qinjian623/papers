## Subfields
 Perception / Traffic Sign Recognition (Edge AI / Efficient Training)
## Reason for Interest

The paper proposes a novel 'Greedy Deterministic Information Bottleneck' (Greedy-DIB) method for layer-wise training, which eliminates global backpropagation and reduces memory usage—a relevant attribute for on-device learning in vehicles. However, the study relies on outdated architectures (VGG-16, ResNet-18) and the absolute performance on traffic sign recognition (97.88% on GTSRB) is significantly below the long-established domain SOTA (>99.5%). While theoretically interesting for edge adaptation, the performance gap on complex tasks (CIFAR-100) and the use of legacy baselines limit its immediate practical value for high-performance autonomous driving stacks.
