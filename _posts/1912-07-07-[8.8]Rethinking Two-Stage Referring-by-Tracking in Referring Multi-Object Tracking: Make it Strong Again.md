## Subfields
 多模态感知 / 目标追踪 (Referring MOT)
## Reason for Interest

论文针对引用多目标追踪（RMOT）任务，成功复兴了‘两阶段’（Two-Stage）范式，具有极高的工程应用价值。其创新点在于通过C-Hook直接从Backbone特征图中采样而非重新编码裁剪图像，保留了上下文梯度流并显著降低了计算成本，不仅解决了传统两阶段方法特征构建割裂的问题，还在自动驾驶相关数据集（Refer-KITTI系列）上取得了显著的SOTA性能。该方法模块化程度高，能灵活适配现有的车端追踪器，且训练和推理效率远优于端到端的一阶段方法，非常适合自动驾驶感知系统的增量部署与人机交互功能扩展。
## Abstract: 
Referring Multi-Object Tracking (RMOT) aims to track multiple objects specified by natural language expressions in videos. With the recent significant progress of one-stage methods, the two-stage Referring-by-Tracking (RBT) paradigm has gradually lost its popularity. However, its lower training cost and flexible incremental deployment remain irreplaceable. Rethinking existing two-stage RBT frameworks, we identify two fundamental limitations: the overly heuristic feature construction and fragile correspondence modeling. To address these issues, we propose FlexHook, a novel two-stage RBT framework. In FlexHook, the proposed Conditioning Hook (C-Hook) redefines the feature construction by a sampling-based strategy and language-conditioned cue injection. Then, we introduce a Pairwise Correspondence Decoder (PCD) that replaces CLIP-based similarity matching with active correspondence modeling, yielding a more flexible and robust strategy. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmarks (Refer-KITTI/v2, Refer-Dance, and LaMOT) demonstrate that FlexHook becomes the first two-stage RBT approach to comprehensively outperform current state-of-the-art methods. Code can be found in the Supplementary Materials.
