 定位与建图 (SLAM) / 回环检测
## Reason for Interest

论文针对大规模SLAM中回环检测和位姿图优化的计算瓶颈，提出了一种名为MSA（Minimal Subset Approach）的关键帧在线采样方法。创新性在于不依赖传统的3D几何距离，而是基于特征空间（descriptor space）定义“信息保留”和“冗余最小化”指标，通过滑动窗口优化选择最具价值的关键帧。实验设计严谨，涵盖了城市道路（KITTI, Apollo）、校园（MulRan）等多种自动驾驶典型场景，并验证了对不同描述子（Scan Context, OverlapTransformer）的适应性。该方法有效解决了长距离建图中的资源与精度平衡问题，且已开源代码，具有较高的工程应用价值。
## Abstract: 
Typical LiDAR SLAM architectures feature a front-end for odometry estimation and a back-end for refining and optimizing the trajectory and map, commonly through loop closures. However, loop closure detection in large-scale missions presents significant computational challenges due to the need to identify, verify, and process numerous candidate pairs for pose graph optimization. Keyframe sampling bridges the front-end and back-end by selecting frames for storing and processing during global optimization. This article proposes an online keyframe sampling approach that constructs the pose graph using the most impactful keyframes for loop closure. We introduce the Minimal Subset Approach (MSA), which optimizes two key objectives: redundancy minimization and information preservation, implemented within a sliding window framework. By operating in the feature space rather than 3-D space, MSA efficiently reduces redundant keyframes while retaining essential information. Evaluations on diverse public datasets show that the proposed approach outperforms naive methods in reducing false positive rates in place recognition, while delivering superior ATE and RPE in metric localization, without the need for manual parameter tuning. Additionally, MSA demonstrates efficiency and scalability by reducing memory usage and computational overhead during loop closure detection and pose graph optimization.
