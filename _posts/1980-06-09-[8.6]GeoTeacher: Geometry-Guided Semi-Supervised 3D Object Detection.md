## Subfields
 3D目标检测 / 半监督学习 (LiDAR)
## Reason for Interest

该论文针对半监督3D检测中标签稀缺导致几何信息提取不足的问题，提出了两个创新模块：基于关键点的几何关系监督(GRS)和距离衰减体素增强(DVA)。
1. 创新性：GRS利用物体内部关键点（中心、角点等）的相对关系作为监督信号，比单纯的特征一致性更能捕捉结构信息；DVA通过距离感知的数据增强策略，有效解决了LiDAR点云远近密度不均的问题，设计合理且符合物理规律。
2. 实验完整性：在ONCE和Waymo两大主流数据集上进行了详尽测试，涵盖不同标签比例（5%, 20%等），并验证了在不同检测器（PV-RCNN, CenterPoint）上的通用性，消融实验清晰证明了各模块的有效性。
3. 结果可信度：在现有SOTA方法（如ProficientTeacher, PTPM）基础上均有一致性提升，且提供了代码开源链接，结果具有较高的可信度和行业应用价值，能够有效降低自动驾驶数据标注成本。
## Abstract: 
Semi-supervised 3D object detection, aiming to explore unlabeled data for boosting 3D object detectors, has emerged as an active research area in recent years. Some previous methods have shown substantial improvements by either employing heterogeneous teacher models to provide high-quality pseudo labels or enforcing feature-perspective consistency between the teacher and student networks. However, these methods overlook the fact that the model usually tends to exhibit low sensitivity to object geometries with limited labeled data, making it difficult to capture geometric information, which is crucial for enhancing the student model's ability in object perception and localization. In this paper, we propose GeoTeacher to enhance the student model's ability to capture geometric relations of objects with limited training data, especially unlabeled data. We design a keypoint-based geometric relation supervision module that transfers the teacher model's knowledge of object geometry to the student, thereby improving the student's capability in understanding geometric relations. Furthermore, we introduce a voxel-wise data augmentation strategy that increases the diversity of object geometries, thereby further improving the student model's ability to comprehend geometric structures. To preserve the integrity of distant objects during augmentation, we incorporate a distance-decay mechanism into this strategy. Moreover, GeoTeacher can be combined with different SS3D methods to further improve their performance. Extensive experiments on the ONCE and Waymo datasets indicate the effectiveness and generalization of our method and we achieve the new state-of-the-art results.
