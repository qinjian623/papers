## Subfields
 3D感知 / 多模态融合 (恶劣天气场景)
## Reason for Interest

该论文针对自动驾驶长尾难题——恶劣天气下的感知失效，提出了一套基于扩散模型修复与双向自适应对齐 (BAFAM) 的完整框架。创新性在于利用扩散模型强大的生成能力修复图像并引导点云补全，同时通过自适应融合模块解决了修复带来的特征未对齐问题。实验非常扎实，不仅在合成数据集KITTI-C上大幅领先，更在真实数据集DENSE上展现了卓越的泛化能力 (解决了传统融合算法在严重遮挡下性能不如单模态的问题)。虽然4.3 FPS (RTX 4090) 的推理速度距离量产部署尚有差距，但其为提升感知系统的鲁棒性提供了极具价值的研究方向。
## Abstract: 
Multi-modal 3D object detection is important for reliable perception in robotics and autonomous driving. However, its effectiveness remains limited under adverse weather conditions due to weather-induced distortions and misalignment between different data modalities. In this work, we propose DiffFusion, a novel framework designed to enhance robustness in challenging weather through diffusion-based restoration and adaptive cross-modal fusion. Our key insight is that diffusion models possess strong capabilities for denoising and generating data that can adapt to various weather conditions. Building on this, DiffFusion introduces Diffusion-IR restoring images degraded by weather effects and Point Cloud Restoration (PCR) compensating for corrupted LiDAR data using image object cues. To tackle misalignments between two modalities, we develop Bidirectional Adaptive Fusion and Alignment Module (BAFAM). It enables dynamic multi-modal fusion and bidirectional bird's-eye view (BEV) alignment to maintain consistent spatial correspondence. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that DiffFusion achieves state-of-the-art robustness under adverse weather while preserving strong clean-data performance. Zero-shot results on the real-world DENSE dataset further validate its generalization. The implementation of our DiffFusion will be released as open-source.
