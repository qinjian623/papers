论文提出了一种结合生物启发与连续时间 ODE 的创新注意力机制（NAC），理论扎实且具有较强的通用性。在自动驾驶领域，该方法被应用于端到端车道保持任务，并展示了在仿真环境下优于 CT-RNN 和 Transformer 变体的性能，且具备较低的内存占用，适合车端部署。然而，自动驾驶实验仅限于简单的仿真环境，缺乏真实世界复杂场景的验证，且性能指标提升幅度较小，主要优势在于计算效率与理论架构的创新。
## Abstract: 
Attention improves representation learning over RNNs, but its discrete nature limits continuous-time (CT) modeling. We introduce Neuronal Attention Circuit (NAC), a novel, biologically plausible CT-Attention mechanism that reformulates attention logits computation as the solution to a linear first-order ODE with nonlinear interlinked gates derived from repurposing \textit{C. elegans} Neuronal Circuit Policies (NCPs) wiring mechanism. NAC replaces dense projections with sparse sensory gates for key-query projections and a sparse backbone network with two heads for computing \textit{content-target} and \textit{learnable time-constant} gates, enabling efficient adaptive dynamics. NAC supports three attention logit computation modes: (i) explicit Euler integration, (ii) exact closed-form solution, and (iii) steady-state approximation. To improve memory intensity, we implemented a sparse Top-\emph{K} pairwise concatenation scheme that selectively curates key-query interactions. We provide rigorous theoretical guarantees, including state stability, bounded approximation errors, and universal approximation. Empirically, we implemented NAC in diverse domains, including irregular time-series classification, lane-keeping for autonomous vehicles, and industrial prognostics. We observed that NAC matches or outperforms competing baselines in accuracy and occupies an intermediate position in runtime and memory efficiency compared with several CT baselines.
