## Subfields
 具身智能 (Embodied AI) / 机器人学习与仿真 (Robot Learning & Sim-to-Real)
## Reason for Interest

1. **创新性**：论文提出了一个名为Arcadia的全生命周期具身学习框架，创新点在于构建了完整的闭环：自主探索采集数据 -> 基于生成式AI的真实场景重建（Sim-from-Real） -> 统一的导航与操作模型训练 -> 真机部署反馈与持续进化。这种利用真实数据自动化生成仿真场景并回流训练的思路（Data Engine / World Model）在方法论上非常先进。
2. **实验完整性**：实验覆盖了多个主流仿真基准（导航VLN和操作VLA）以及Unitree G1人形机器人的真机测试，消融实验清晰地证明了各个模块（尤其是反馈闭环）的有效性。
3. **评分依据**：尽管该文提出的“真实数据驱动仿真重建”和“端到端闭环学习”的方法论对自动驾驶的数据闭环建设（Data-Driven Simulation）具有极高的参考价值，但其具体研究对象为人形机器人（Humanoid）及室内交互任务，属于具身智能领域，并非直接针对车端自动驾驶场景。严格遵循“如果不直接和车端自动驾驶相关，最多5分”的评分规则，给出5.0分。
## Abstract: 
We contend that embodied learning is fundamentally a lifecycle problem rather than a single-stage optimization. Systems that optimize only one link (data collection, simulation, learning, or deployment) rarely sustain improvement or generalize beyond narrow settings. We introduce Arcadia, a closed-loop framework that operationalizes embodied lifelong learning by tightly coupling four stages: (1) Self-evolving exploration and grounding for autonomous data acquisition in physical environments, (2) Generative scene reconstruction and augmentation for realistic and extensible scene creation, (3) a Shared embodied representation architecture that unifies navigation and manipulation within a single multimodal backbone, and (4) Sim-from-real evaluation and evolution that closes the feedback loop through simulation-based adaptation. This coupling is non-decomposable: removing any stage breaks the improvement loop and reverts to one-shot training. Arcadia delivers consistent gains on navigation and manipulation benchmarks and transfers robustly to physical robots, indicating that a tightly coupled lifecycle: continuous real-world data acquisition, generative simulation update, and shared-representation learning, supports lifelong improvement and end-to-end generalization. We release standardized interfaces enabling reproducible evaluation and cross-model comparison in reusable environments, positioning Arcadia as a scalable foundation for general-purpose embodied agents.
