## Subfields
 3D Perception / Multi-modal Fusion / Adverse Weather
## Reason for Interest

The paper addresses a critical challenge in autonomous driving: perception robustness in adverse weather. It innovatively applies diffusion models for sensor data restoration (image and LiDAR) combined with a bidirectional adaptive fusion module (BAFAM) to handle misalignment. The experimental results on KITTI-C and DENSE demonstrate superior robustness compared to current SOTA methods. However, the inference speed (4.3 FPS on RTX 4090) is currently too slow for real-time onboard deployment, which slightly impacts its industry potential score despite the high academic value.
