## Reason for Interest

该论文针对自动驾驶仿真中行人行为僵硬、单一的痛点，提出了一个极具价值的高保真仿真基准。核心贡献在于：1. **高真实感数据集成**：设计了一套完整的流程，将真实世界的动作捕捉数据（MoCap）和视频提取动作高质量地重定向（Retargeting）到CARLA模拟器中，解决了骨骼和坐标系不匹配的技术难题，提供了4730个交通相关的真实行人动作。2. **深度评估指标**：引入了医学损伤量表（AIS）和假阳性刹车率（FPBR），比单纯的碰撞率更能反映自动驾驶系统对弱势道路使用者（VRU）的安全性和通行效率的影响。3. **揭示行业盲点**：实验有力地证明了现有顶级端到端规划算法（如InterFuser）在面对真实、多样化的人类行为时存在严重的过度保守或反应不足问题。这是一个对自动驾驶安全落地具有重要参考价值的基础设施类工作。
## Abstract: 
Current autonomous driving (AD) simulations are critically limited by their inadequate representation of realistic and diverse human behavior, which is essential for ensuring safety and reliability. Existing benchmarks often simplify pedestrian interactions, failing to capture complex, dynamic intentions and varied responses critical for robust system deployment. To overcome this, we introduce HABIT (Human Action Benchmark for Interactive Traffic), a high-fidelity simulation benchmark. HABIT integrates real-world human motion, sourced from mocap and videos, into CARLA (Car Learning to Act, a full autonomous driving simulator) via a modular, extensible, and physically consistent motion retargeting pipeline. From an initial pool of approximately 30,000 retargeted motions, we curate 4,730 traffic-compatible pedestrian motions, standardized in SMPL format for physically consistent trajectories. HABIT seamlessly integrates with CARLA's Leaderboard, enabling automated scenario generation and rigorous agent evaluation. Our safety metrics, including Abbreviated Injury Scale (AIS) and False Positive Braking Rate (FPBR), reveal critical failure modes in state-of-the-art AD agents missed by prior evaluations. Evaluating three state-of-the-art autonomous driving agents, InterFuser, TransFuser, and BEVDriver, demonstrates how HABIT exposes planner weaknesses that remain hidden in scripted simulations. Despite achieving close or equal to zero collisions per kilometer on the CARLA Leaderboard, the autonomous agents perform notably worse on HABIT, with up to 7.43 collisions/km and a 12.94% AIS 3+ injury risk, and they brake unnecessarily in up to 33% of cases. All components are publicly released to support reproducible, pedestrian-aware AI research.
