## Reason for Interest

该论文针对占用网络世界模型（Occupancy World Models）中计算量大和长时预测误差累积的问题，提出了一种基于Delta-Triplane（增量三平面）的创新架构。核心创新在于：1. 使用Triplane替代单纯的BEV特征，保留了高度信息且比完整3D体素更紧凑；2. 预测‘变化量（Delta）’而非全量状态，利用场景变化的稀疏性大幅降低了建模难度并减少了误差累积。实验部分非常扎实，在Occ3D和nuScenes上对比了OccWorld、DOME、OccLLaMA等最新强基线，在感知预测精度、规划安全性和实时性上均取得了显著的SOTA优势。该方法逻辑清晰，工程价值高，是端到端自动驾驶世界模型方向的重要进展。
## Abstract: 
Occupancy World Models (OWMs) aim to predict future scenes via 3D voxelized representations of the environment to support intelligent motion planning. Existing approaches typically generate full future occupancy states from VAE-style latent encodings, which can be computationally expensive and redundant. We propose Delta-Triplane Transformers (DTT), a novel 4D OWM for autonomous driving, that introduces two key innovations: (1) a triplane based representation that encodes 3D occupancy more compactly than previous approaches, and (2) an incremental prediction strategy for OWM that models {\em changes} in occupancy rather than dealing with full states. The core insight is that changes in the compact 3D latent space are naturally sparser and easier to model, enabling higher accuracy with a lighter-weight architecture. Building on this representation, DTT extracts multi-scale motion features from historical data and iteratively predict future triplane deltas. These deltas are combined with past states to decode future occupancy and ego-motion trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DTT delivers a 1.44$\times$ speedup (26 FPS) over the state of the art, improves mean IoU to 30.85, and reduces the mean absolute planning error to 1.0 meters. Demo videos are provided in the supplementary material.
