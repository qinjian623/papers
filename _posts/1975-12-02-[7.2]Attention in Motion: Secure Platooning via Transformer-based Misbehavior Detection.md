## Subfields
 V2X Platooning Security / Misbehavior Detection
## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种基于Transformer的AIMFORMER框架，用于检测网联自动驾驶车队中的恶意行为。创新性方面，结合了全局位置编码和车辆特定的时间偏移，有效处理了车队动态（如加入/退出）；实验完整性较高，涵盖了多种攻击场景、控制器类型，并在真实边缘硬件（Jetson Orin Nano）上进行了TensorRT/TFLite部署验证，证明了其实时性（<1ms）；可信度方面，方法论严谨，但依赖SUMO仿真数据而非真实路测数据，略微降低了在复杂现实环境下的说服力；行业潜力方面，对于落地C-V2X编队驾驶的安全子系统具有较高参考价值。
## Abstract: 
Vehicular platooning promises transformative improvements in transportation efficiency and safety through the coordination of multi-vehicle formations enabled by Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) communication. However, the distributed nature of platoon coordination creates security vulnerabilities, allowing authenticated vehicles to inject falsified kinematic data, compromise operational stability, and pose a threat to passenger safety. Traditional misbehaviour detection approaches, which rely on plausibility checks and statistical methods, suffer from high False Positive (FP) rates and cannot capture the complex temporal dependencies inherent in multi-vehicle coordination dynamics. We present Attention In Motion (AIMformer), a transformer-based framework specifically tailored for real-time misbehaviour detection in vehicular platoons with edge deployment capabilities. AIMformer leverages multi-head self-attention mechanisms to simultaneously capture intra-vehicle temporal dynamics and inter-vehicle spatial correlations. It incorporates global positional encoding with vehicle-specific temporal offsets to handle join/exit maneuvers. We propose a Precision-Focused Binary Cross-Entropy (PFBCE) loss function that penalizes FPs to meet the requirements of safety-critical vehicular systems. Extensive evaluation across 4 platoon controllers, multiple attack vectors, and diverse mobility scenarios demonstrates superior performance ($\geq$ 0.93) compared to state-of-the-art baseline architectures. A comprehensive deployment analysis utilizing TensorFlow Lite (TFLite), Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX), and TensorRT achieves sub-millisecond inference latency, making it suitable for real-time operation on resource-constrained edge platforms. Hence, validating AIMformer is viable for both in-vehicle and roadside infrastructure deployment.
