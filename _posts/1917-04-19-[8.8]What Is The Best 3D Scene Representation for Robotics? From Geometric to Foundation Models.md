## Subfields
 3D场景表征 / SLAM与感知综述
## Reason for Interest

这是一篇发表于IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 的高质量综述文章。文章系统梳理了机器人（包含自动驾驶）领域的3D场景表征方法，详尽阐述了从传统几何表征（点云、体素、SDF）向神经表征（NeRF、3DGS）及基础模型（Foundation Models）演进的技术脉络。对于自动驾驶研究而言，该论文深入探讨了这些表征在感知（Perception）、建图与定位（SLAM/Mapping/Localization）以及导航（Navigation）中的应用，特别是指出了NeRF和3D Gaussian Splatting在室外大场景重建、语义理解及端到端自动驾驶中的潜力与挑战。尽管涵盖了通用机器人领域（如机械臂抓取），但其对Waymo、nuScenes等数据集相关工作的梳理以及对未来通用化、开放词汇感知的讨论，对自动驾驶从模块化向端到端大模型转型具有极高的参考价值。
## Abstract: 
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive overview of existing scene representation methods for robotics, covering traditional representations such as point clouds, voxels, signed distance functions (SDF), and scene graphs, as well as more recent neural representations like Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF), 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), and the emerging Foundation Models. While current SLAM and localization systems predominantly rely on sparse representations like point clouds and voxels, dense scene representations are expected to play a critical role in downstream tasks such as navigation and obstacle avoidance. Moreover, neural representations such as NeRF, 3DGS, and foundation models are well-suited for integrating high-level semantic features and language-based priors, enabling more comprehensive 3D scene understanding and embodied intelligence. In this paper, we categorized the core modules of robotics into five parts (Perception, Mapping, Localization, Navigation, Manipulation). We start by presenting the standard formulation of different scene representation methods and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of scene representation across different modules. This survey is centered around the question: What is the best 3D scene representation for robotics? We then discuss the future development trends of 3D scene representations, with a particular focus on how the 3D Foundation Model could replace current methods as the unified solution for future robotic applications. The remaining challenges in fully realizing this model are also explored. We aim to offer a valuable resource for both newcomers and experienced researchers to explore the future of 3D scene representations and their application in robotics. We have published an open-source project on GitHub and will continue to add new works and technologies to this project.
