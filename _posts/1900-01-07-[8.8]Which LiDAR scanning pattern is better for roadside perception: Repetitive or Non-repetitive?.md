该论文针对自动驾驶领域中一个被低估但至关重要的方面——基础设施LiDAR的扫描模式对感知性能的影响，进行了深入研究。其创新性体现在：1) 明确识别并填补了现有研究主要关注LiDAR放置而非扫描模式的空白；2) 引入并公开了一个新颖、全面的“InfraLiDARs’ Benchmark”数据集，该数据集在CARLA仿真环境中精心收集，涵盖了重复性和非重复性两种扫描范式下的多种LiDAR和交通场景，为未来研究提供了宝贵资源；3) 提出了一个系统的评估框架，用于比较不同扫描模式的LiDAR对主流3D目标检测算法性能的影响。实验设计全面，涵盖了多种LiDAR类型、交通场景和领先的3D目标检测算法，这展示了良好的实验完整性。虽然数据来源于仿真环境，但作者明确指出了其优点（如可控性、避免标定问题、地面真值易得），且数据集的公开进一步提升了研究的可信度。本研究的成果具有极高的行业潜力，能够为自动驾驶系统在基础设施端进行传感器选型、部署优化和算法适配提供直接、可操作的指导，尤其是在V2I（车路协同）和智能交通系统（ITS）领域。
## Abstract: 
LiDAR-based roadside perception is a cornerstone of advanced Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). While considerable research has addressed optimal LiDAR placement for infrastructure, the profound impact of differing LiDAR scanning patterns on perceptual performance remains comparatively under-investigated. The inherent nature of various scanning modes - such as traditional repetitive (mechanical/solid-state) versus emerging non-repetitive (e.g. prism-based) systems - leads to distinct point cloud distributions at varying distances, critically dictating the efficacy of object detection and overall environmental understanding. To systematically investigate these differences in infrastructure-based contexts, we introduce the "InfraLiDARs' Benchmark," a novel dataset meticulously collected in the CARLA simulation environment using concurrently operating infrastructure-based LiDARs exhibiting both scanning paradigms. Leveraging this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis of the respective LiDAR scanning abilities and evaluate the impact of these distinct patterns on the performance of various leading 3D object detection algorithms. Our findings reveal that non-repetitive scanning LiDAR and the 128-line repetitive LiDAR were found to exhibit comparable detection performance across various scenarios. Despite non-repetitive LiDAR's limited perception range, it's a cost-effective option considering its low price. Ultimately, this study provides insights for setting up roadside perception system with optimal LiDAR scanning patterns and compatible algorithms for diverse roadside applications, and publicly releases the "InfraLiDARs' Benchmark" dataset to foster further research.
