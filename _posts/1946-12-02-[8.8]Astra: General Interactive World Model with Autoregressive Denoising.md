该论文提出了一种通用的交互式世界模型 Astra，针对自动驾驶仿真和机器人控制等任务中的‘视觉惯性’（Visual Inertia，即模型倾向于忽略动作输入而过度依赖历史帧）问题，创新性地提出了噪声增强记忆（Noise-Augmented Memory）和混合动作专家（MoAE）机制。实验部分在 nuScenes 等数据集上充分验证了其生成长时序、可控驾驶视频的能力，能够响应转向、加速等驾驶指令，生成的视频在物理一致性和指令跟随度上表现出色。虽然是一篇通用世界模型的论文，但其对自动驾驶闭环仿真、端到端自动驾驶的数据生成与预训练具有重要的行业价值和启发意义，技术路线清晰且代码已开源，可信度高。
## Abstract: 
Recent advances in diffusion transformers have empowered video generation models to generate high-quality video clips from texts or images. However, world models with the ability to predict long-horizon futures from past observations and actions remain underexplored, especially for general-purpose scenarios and various forms of actions. To bridge this gap, we introduce Astra, an interactive general world model that generates real-world futures for diverse scenarios (e.g., autonomous driving, robot grasping) with precise action interactions (e.g., camera motion, robot action). We propose an autoregressive denoising architecture and use temporal causal attention to aggregate past observations and support streaming outputs. We use a noise-augmented history memory to avoid over-reliance on past frames to balance responsiveness with temporal coherence. For precise action control, we introduce an action-aware adapter that directly injects action signals into the denoising process. We further develop a mixture of action experts that dynamically route heterogeneous action modalities, enhancing versatility across diverse real-world tasks such as exploration, manipulation, and camera control. Astra achieves interactive, consistent, and general long-term video prediction and supports various forms of interactions. Experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate the improvements of Astra in fidelity, long-range prediction, and action alignment over existing state-of-the-art world models.
