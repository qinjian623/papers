## Subfields
 轨迹预测 / 恶劣天气感知
## Reason for Interest

论文针对自动驾驶长尾难题（雾天）提出了结合物理光学先验与Mamba架构的创新方案。物理去雾与轨迹预测的端到端联合训练思路具备较强的启发性；在合成数据集上取得了显著的性能提升且推理效率极高。主要短板在于实验依赖俯视视角的合成雾数据，缺乏真实车端视角恶劣天气数据的验证。
## Abstract: 
  Finally, to efficiently model pedestrian relationships, we develop a heterogeneous graph attention network, using graph matrices to model multi-granularity interactions between pedestrians and groups, combined with a spatio-temporal fusion module to capture the collaborative evolution patterns of pedestrian movements. Furthermore, we constructed a new pedestrian trajectory prediction dataset based on ETH/UCY to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Experiments show that our method reduces the minADE / minFDE metrics by 37.2% and 41.5%, respectively, compared to the SOTA models in dense haze scenarios (visibility < 30m), providing a new modeling paradigm for reliable perception in intelligent transportation systems in adverse environments.
