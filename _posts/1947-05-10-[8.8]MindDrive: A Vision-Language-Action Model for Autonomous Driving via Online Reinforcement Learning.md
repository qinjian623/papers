## Subfields
 端到端自动驾驶 / 视觉-语言-动作模型 (VLA) / 在线强化学习
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性强：论文切中了当前VLA模型仅依赖模仿学习（IL）导致因果推理能力弱、易受分布偏移影响的痛点，成功将在线强化学习（Online RL）引入VLA训练框架。通过解耦Decision Expert（决策）和Action Expert（轨迹）并利用LoRA进行高效微调，解决了语言空间探索效率低的问题。
2. 实验扎实：在极具挑战性的Bench2Drive闭环榜单上验证了有效性。特别是以0.5B的轻量级模型击败了7B量级的模型，证明了方法的效率和潜力。
3. 行业价值：虽然实验局限于CARLA仿真环境（这是RL研究的通病），但其提出的'IL预训练 + Online RL微调'范式为端到端大模型上车提供了重要的技术路径，尤其是对于解决长尾场景和提升推理鲁棒性有重要参考价值。
4. 局限性：缺乏真值系统的实车验证，Sim-to-Real的鸿沟未在文中解决，但这不影响其学术贡献的高分评价。
## Abstract: 
Current Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigms in autonomous driving primarily rely on Imitation Learning (IL), which introduces inherent challenges such as distribution shift and causal confusion. Online Reinforcement Learning offers a promising pathway to address these issues through trial-and-error learning. However, applying online reinforcement learning to VLA models in autonomous driving is hindered by inefficient exploration in continuous action spaces. To overcome this limitation, we propose MindDrive, a VLA framework comprising a large language model (LLM) with two distinct sets of LoRA parameters. The one LLM serves as a Decision Expert for scenario reasoning and driving decision-making, while the other acts as an Action Expert that dynamically maps linguistic decisions into feasible trajectories. By feeding trajectory-level rewards back into the reasoning space, MindDrive enables trial-and-error learning over a finite set of discrete linguistic driving decisions, instead of operating directly in a continuous action space. This approach effectively balances optimal decision-making in complex scenarios, human-like driving behavior, and efficient exploration in online reinforcement learning. MindDrive achieves strong closed-loop performance on the challenging Bench2Drive benchmark, with a Driving Score (DS) of 78.04 and a Success Rate (SR) of 55.09%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate the effectiveness of online reinforcement learning for the VLA model in autonomous driving.
