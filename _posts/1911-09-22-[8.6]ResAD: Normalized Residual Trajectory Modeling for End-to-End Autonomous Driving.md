4. **方法通用性**：论文展示了该方法作为即插即用模块可提升其他模型（如 Transfuser）的性能，具有较好的通用价值。
## Abstract: 
End-to-end autonomous driving (E2EAD) systems, which learn to predict future trajectories directly from sensor data, are fundamentally challenged by the inherent spatio-temporal imbalance of trajectory data. This imbalance creates a significant optimization burden, causing models to learn spurious correlations instead of robust driving logic, while also prioritizing uncertain, distant predictions, thereby compromising immediate safety. To address these issues, we propose ResAD, a novel Normalized Residual Trajectory Modeling framework. Instead of predicting the future trajectory directly, our approach reframes and simplifies the learning task by predicting the residual deviation from a deterministic inertial reference. This inertial reference serves as a strong physical prior, compelling the model to move beyond simple pattern-matching and instead focus its capacity on learning the necessary, context-driven deviations (e.g., traffic rules, obstacles) from this default, inertially-guided path. To mitigate the optimization imbalance caused by uncertain, long-term horizons, ResAD further incorporates Point-wise Normalization of the predicted residual. This technique re-weights the optimization objective, preventing large-magnitude errors associated with distant, uncertain waypoints from dominating the learning signal. On the NAVSIM v1 and v2 benchmarks, ResAD achieves state-of-the-art results of 88.8 PDMS and 85.5 EPDMS with only two denoising steps, demonstrating that ResAD significantly simplifies the learning task and improves planning performance. The code will be released to facilitate further research.
