## Subfields
 纯视觉3D占据预测 / 弱监督学习 (Vision-based Occupancy Prediction / Weakly Supervised Learning)
## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种极具价值的“货架监督”（Shelf-Supervised）范式，利用现成的视觉基础模型（MapAnything提取几何，GroundedSAM提取语义）生成高质量的3D伪标签，替代了以往基于NeRF或Gaussian Splatting的2D渲染监督。创新性在于有效解决了渲染监督中常见的“深度泄露”（depth bleeding）和几何模糊问题，并通过动静分离策略处理动态场景。实验结果显示其性能不仅大幅超越现有的弱监督方法，甚至在部分指标上能够媲美依赖LiDAR数据的监督方法。该方案解耦了伪标签生成与模型训练，允许使用任意高效的3D占据网络架构，极大地降低了数据标注成本，对自动驾驶去LiDAR化和低成本数据闭环具有极高的工业应用价值。
## Abstract: 
Recent progress in self- and weakly supervised occupancy estimation has largely relied on 2D projection or rendering-based supervision, which suffers from geometric inconsistencies and severe depth bleeding. We thus introduce ShelfOcc, a vision-only method that overcomes these limitations without relying on LiDAR. ShelfOcc brings supervision into native 3D space by generating metrically consistent semantic voxel labels from video, enabling true 3D supervision without any additional sensors or manual 3D annotations. While recent vision-based 3D geometry foundation models provide a promising source of prior knowledge, they do not work out of the box as a prediction due to sparse or noisy and inconsistent geometry, especially in dynamic driving scenes. Our method introduces a dedicated framework that mitigates these issues by filtering and accumulating static geometry consistently across frames, handling dynamic content and propagating semantic information into a stable voxel representation. This data-centric shift in supervision for weakly/shelf-supervised occupancy estimation allows the use of essentially any SOTA occupancy model architecture without relying on LiDAR data. We argue that such high-quality supervision is essential for robust occupancy learning and constitutes an important complementary avenue to architectural innovation. On the Occ3D-nuScenes benchmark, ShelfOcc substantially outperforms all previous weakly/shelf-supervised methods (up to a 34% relative improvement), establishing a new data-driven direction for LiDAR-free 3D scene understanding.
