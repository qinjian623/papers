## Subfields
 3D Perception / Fisheye 3D Object Detection
## Reason for Interest

The paper addresses a highly practical industrial problem: utilizing existing surround-view fisheye cameras for 3D perception. The proposed spherical coordinate modeling (FisheyeBEVDet/PETR) is theoretically sound and outperforms naive image rectification methods. However, the score is capped because the evaluation relies entirely on synthetic data (CARLA). The absence of real-world validation is a critical gap for fisheye perception, where lens distortion and lighting artifacts are complex. While the 'Fisheye3DOD' dataset contributes to the community, the findings serve more as a feasibility study than a deployment-ready solution.
