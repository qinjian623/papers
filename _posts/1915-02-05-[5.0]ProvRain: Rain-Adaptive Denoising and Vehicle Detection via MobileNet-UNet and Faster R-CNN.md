## Subfields
 2D感知 / 恶劣天气下的车辆检测 (Nighttime & Adverse Weather Detection)
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性有限：该论文提出了一种将图像去噪（MobileNet-U-Net）作为预处理步骤挂载在检测器（Faster R-CNN）之前的级联架构。这种'先增强后检测'的方法在自动驾驶感知中属于较为传统且偏工程的方案，缺乏算法层面的深度创新。课程学习（Curriculum Training）虽然被用于训练去噪网络，但也是标准策略。
2. 实用性与局限性：针对夜间雨天这一长尾场景（Corner Case）具有实际安全意义。然而，引入去噪模块导致推理速度从20 FPS下降至14 FPS，增加了系统延迟，这在对实时性要求极高的自动驾驶场景中是一个明显的缺点。现代主流方法倾向于通过数据增强使检测器直接具备鲁棒性，而非增加昂贵的推理时预处理。
3. 实验设计：实验在PVDN数据集上进行，但为了模拟不同程度的雨天，大量使用了合成数据（Synthetic Data）进行训练和评估，其在真实复杂雨天场景下的泛化能力有待进一步验证。对比实验主要集中在去噪效果（对比SwinIR等）和自身基线对比，缺乏与当前最先进的鲁棒目标检测算法（如YOLOv8/10、端到端Transformer检测器等）的横向比较。
4. 综合评价：一篇解决特定问题的工程应用型论文，技术栈（MobileNet, Faster R-CNN）稍显陈旧，对自动驾驶社区的启发性一般。
## Abstract: 
Provident vehicle detection has a lot of scope in the detection of vehicle during night time. The extraction of features other than the headlamps of vehicles allows us to detect oncoming vehicles before they appear directly on the camera. However, it faces multiple issues especially in the field of night vision, where a lot of noise caused due to weather conditions such as rain or snow as well as camera conditions. This paper focuses on creating a pipeline aimed at dealing with such noise while at the same time maintaining the accuracy of provident vehicular detection. The pipeline in this paper, ProvRain, uses a lightweight MobileNet-U-Net architecture tuned to generalize to robust weather conditions by using the concept of curricula training. A mix of synthetic as well as available data from the PVDN dataset is used for this. This pipeline is compared to the base Faster RCNN architecture trained on the PVDN dataset to see how much the addition of a denoising architecture helps increase the detection model's performance in rainy conditions. The system boasts an 8.94\% increase in accuracy and a 10.25\% increase in recall in the detection of vehicles in rainy night time frames. Similarly, the custom MobileNet-U-Net architecture that was trained also shows a 10-15\% improvement in PSNR, a 5-6\% increase in SSIM, and upto a 67\% reduction in perceptual error (LPIPS) compared to other transformer approaches.
