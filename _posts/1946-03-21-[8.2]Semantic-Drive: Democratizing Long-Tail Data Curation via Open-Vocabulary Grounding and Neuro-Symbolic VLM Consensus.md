## Reason for Interest

论文针对自动驾驶数据长尾分布和'暗数据'挖掘难题，提出了一种创新的神经符号学框架。其核心价值在于：1. **架构创新**：结合实时检测器(YOLOE)进行符号锚定与多VLM(Judge-Scout)进行逻辑推理，有效解决了纯VLM在小目标检测和幻觉上的痛点；2. **工程实用性**：强调本地化部署(单卡RTX 3090)和隐私保护，极大降低了数据挖掘成本，符合行业对DataOps的迫切需求；3. **实验效果**：在复杂场景检索上展现了极高的召回率和语义理解能力。主要扣分点在于定量评估的**样本量较小**（Gold Set仅116帧），且为自定义测试集，在大规模泛化性上仍需进一步验证。
## Abstract: 
The development of robust Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) is bottlenecked by the scarcity of "Long-Tail" training data. While fleets collect petabytes of video logs, identifying rare safety-critical events (e.g., erratic jaywalking, construction diversions) remains a manual, cost-prohibitive process. Existing solutions rely on coarse metadata search, which lacks precision, or cloud-based VLMs, which are privacy-invasive and expensive. We introduce Semantic-Drive, a local-first, neuro-symbolic framework for semantic data mining. Our approach decouples perception into two stages: (1) Symbolic Grounding via a real-time open-vocabulary detector (YOLOE) to anchor attention, and (2) Cognitive Analysis via a Reasoning VLM that performs forensic scene analysis. To mitigate hallucination, we implement a "System 2" inference-time alignment strategy, utilizing a multi-model "Judge-Scout" consensus mechanism. Benchmarked on the nuScenes dataset against the Waymo Open Dataset (WOD-E2E) taxonomy, Semantic-Drive achieves a Recall of 0.966 (vs. 0.475 for CLIP) and reduces Risk Assessment Error by 40\% compared to single models. The system runs entirely on consumer hardware (NVIDIA RTX 3090), offering a privacy-preserving alternative to the cloud.
