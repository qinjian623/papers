论文针对自动驾驶仿真中的'长尾'数据生成问题，提出了一种基于对称自回归在线修复（SymDrive）的统一框架。创新点在于利用对称视角构建双目约束来训练扩散模型，有效解决了侧向大视角偏移下的几何与纹理一致性问题，并实现了高质量的车辆插入编辑（光影和谐）。实验在 Waymo 数据集上验证了其在渲染质量和编辑真实感上的优势，并展示了支持 VLM 闭环测试的潜力。工作完整，针对性强，对构建高保真仿真环境具有重要价值。
## Abstract: 
High-fidelity and controllable 3D simulation is essential for addressing the long-tail data scarcity in Autonomous Driving (AD), yet existing methods struggle to simultaneously achieve photorealistic rendering and interactive traffic editing. Current approaches often falter in large-angle novel view synthesis and suffer from geometric or lighting artifacts during asset manipulation. To address these challenges, we propose SymDrive, a unified diffusion-based framework capable of joint high-quality rendering and scene editing. We introduce a Symmetric Auto-regressive Online Restoration paradigm, which constructs paired symmetric views to recover fine-grained details via a ground-truth-guided dual-view formulation and utilizes an auto-regressive strategy for consistent lateral view generation. Furthermore, we leverage this restoration capability to enable a training-free harmonization mechanism, treating vehicle insertion as context-aware inpainting to ensure seamless lighting and shadow consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SymDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance in both novel-view enhancement and realistic 3D vehicle insertion.
