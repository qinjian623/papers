## Subfields
 智能座舱 / 驾驶员监控系统 (DMS)
## Reason for Interest

该论文属于典型的工程应用类研究，而非算法理论创新。主要贡献在于设计了一套面向低成本边缘计算设备的DMS落地方案，特别是引入了包含‘干扰项’（如梳头、操作中控）的17类行为分类体系，以及基于时序持久性的报警逻辑，有效降低了实际驾驶中的误报率。然而，文章核心算法采用常规CNN骨干网配合后处理规则，缺乏模型架构上的实质创新；且实验主要依赖私有数据集，未与行业主流SOTA方法进行公开基准对比，可复现性和学术参考价值受限。虽然对L3级自动驾驶的人机接管有一定工程参考意义，但不够深入。
## Abstract: 
In-cabin Driver Monitoring Systems (DMS) must recognize distraction- and drowsiness-related behaviors with low latency under strict constraints on compute, power, and cost. We present a single-camera in-cabin driver behavior recognition system designed for deployment on two low-cost edge platforms: Raspberry Pi 5 (CPU-only) and Google Coral Edge TPU. The proposed pipeline combines (i) a compact per-frame vision model, (ii) a confounder-aware label design to reduce visually similar false positives, and (iii) a temporal decision head that triggers alerts only when predictions are both confident and sustained. The system covers 17 behavior classes, including multiple phone-use modes, eating/drinking, smoking, reaching behind, gaze/attention shifts, passenger interaction, grooming, control-panel interaction, yawning, and eyes-closed sleep. Training and evaluation use licensed datasets spanning diverse drivers, vehicles, and lighting conditions (details in Section 6), and we further validate runtime behavior in real in-vehicle tests. The optimized deployments achieve about 16 FPS on Raspberry Pi 5 with INT8 inference (per-frame latency under 60 ms) and about 25 FPS on Coral Edge TPU, enabling real-time monitoring and stable alert generation on inexpensive hardware. Finally, we discuss how reliable in-cabin human-state perception can serve as an upstream input for human-centered vehicle intelligence, including emerging agentic vehicle concepts.
