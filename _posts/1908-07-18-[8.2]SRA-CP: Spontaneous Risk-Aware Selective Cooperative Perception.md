## Subfields
 V2X Cooperative Perception / 3D Object Detection
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性：论文针对V2X协作感知中的带宽瓶颈和动态组网难题，提出了'自发式风险感知'框架。将'何时协作'（基于盲区风险触发）与'传输什么'（基于时空与安全风险的特征选择）有机结合，区别于传统的全时连接或仅基于空间稀疏性的方法，具有较强的逻辑创新。
2. 实用价值：提出的自发（Spontaneous）握手协议更符合现实交通中车辆随机相遇的场景，且大幅降低了无效数据的传输，对V2X技术的实际落地（解决带宽拥塞）有极高参考价值。
3. 实验完整性：在标准的OPV2V数据集上进行了详尽的对比实验，不仅比较了常规AP，还专门设计了Risk-AP来量化安全收益，消融实验充分验证了各模块有效性。
4. 局限性：主要依赖合成数据集OPV2V，缺乏实车数据验证，且风险评估模型依赖较为简单的规则（TTC/距离），在极端复杂场景下的鲁棒性有待进一步证明。
## Abstract: 
Cooperative perception (CP) offers significant potential to overcome the limitations of single-vehicle sensing by enabling information sharing among connected vehicles (CVs). However, existing generic CP approaches need to transmit large volumes of perception data that are irrelevant to the driving safety, exceeding available communication bandwidth. Moreover, most CP frameworks rely on pre-defined communication partners, making them unsuitable for dynamic traffic environments. This paper proposes a Spontaneous Risk-Aware Selective Cooperative Perception (SRA-CP) framework to address these challenges. SRA-CP introduces a decentralized protocol where connected agents continuously broadcast lightweight perception coverage summaries and initiate targeted cooperation only when risk-relevant blind zones are detected. A perceptual risk identification module enables each CV to locally assess the impact of occlusions on its driving task and determine whether cooperation is necessary. When CP is triggered, the ego vehicle selects appropriate peers based on shared perception coverage and engages in selective information exchange through a fusion module that prioritizes safety-critical content and adapts to bandwidth constraints. We evaluate SRA-CP on a public dataset against several representative baselines. Results show that SRA-CP achieves less than 1% average precision (AP) loss for safety-critical objects compared to generic CP, while using only 20% of the communication bandwidth. Moreover, it improves the perception performance by 15% over existing selective CP methods that do not incorporate risk awareness.
