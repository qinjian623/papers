## Subfields
 3D目标检测 / 数据挖掘 (Data Mining)
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性：提出了利用VLM（CLIP+Qwen2-VL）进行可解释性数据挖掘的框架，通过2D语义引导3D场景选择，思路对于解决自动驾驶长尾物体（Rare Object）检测和降低标注成本具有较高的行业应用价值。
2. 实验缺陷：实验验证环节较为薄弱。论文明确表示未与Hard Example Mining、Active Learning（如Entropy, Coreset）等现有的成熟数据选择策略进行对比，仅对比了“随机采样”，这属于“稻草人攻击”，无法充分证明该方法相对于现有挖掘技术的优越性。
3. 技术细节：将t-SNE用于异常检测的离群点判定在数理上不够严谨（t-SNE主要用于可视化，不保持全局距离），且所选用的检测底座（YOLOv8, CenterPoint）在自动驾驶领域已非最新SOTA，限制了其在当前技术栈中的参考意义。
## Abstract: 
Rare-object detection remains a challenging task in autonomous driving systems, particularly when relying solely on point cloud data. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit strong capabilities in image understanding, their potential to enhance 3D object detection through intelligent data mining has not been fully explored. This paper proposes a novel cross-modal framework that leverages 2D VLMs to identify and mine rare objects from driving scenes, thereby improving 3D object detection performance. Our approach synthesizes complementary techniques such as object detection, semantic feature extraction, dimensionality reduction, and multi-faceted outlier detection into a cohesive, explainable pipeline that systematically identifies rare but critical objects in driving scenes. By combining Isolation Forest and t-SNE-based outlier detection methods with concept-based filtering, the framework effectively identifies semantically meaningful rare objects. A key strength of this approach lies in its ability to extract and annotate targeted rare object concepts such as construction vehicles, motorcycles, and barriers. This substantially reduces the annotation burden and focuses only on the most valuable training samples. Experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that this concept-guided data mining strategy enhances the performance of 3D object detection models while utilizing only a fraction of the training data, with particularly notable improvements for challenging object categories such as trailers and bicycles compared with the same amount of random data. This finding has substantial implications for the efficient curation of datasets in safety-critical autonomous systems.
