## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种名为MindDrive的高质量端到端规划框架，创新性地解决了现有‘生成-选择’范式中评估器能力不足的问题。核心贡献在于：1. 引入基于世界模型（WAM）的未来感知轨迹生成器（FaTG），通过‘what-if’推演生成具备前瞻性的候选轨迹；2. 设计了基于VLM的评估器（VLoE），利用多模态大模型的语义推理能力对轨迹进行安全性和舒适性的多维打分。实验非常扎实，在NAVSIM-v1和v2的多个高难度Split（如Navsafe, Navhard）上均取得了SOTA成绩，证明了将世界模型与VLM结合用于闭环规划的有效性，具有较高的行业落地参考价值。
## Abstract: 
End-to-End autonomous driving (E2E-AD) has emerged as a new paradigm, where trajectory planning plays a crucial role. Existing studies mainly follow two directions: trajectory generation oriented, which focuses on producing high-quality trajectories with simple decision mechanisms, and trajectory selection oriented, which performs multi-dimensional evaluation to select the best trajectory yet lacks sufficient generative capability. In this work, we propose MindDrive, a harmonized framework that integrates high-quality trajectory generation with comprehensive decision reasoning. It establishes a structured reasoning paradigm of "context simulation - candidate generation - multi-objective trade-off". In particular, the proposed Future-aware Trajectory Generator (FaTG), based on a World Action Model (WaM), performs ego-conditioned "what-if" simulations to predict potential future scenes and generate foresighted trajectory candidates. Building upon this, the VLM-oriented Evaluator (VLoE) leverages the reasoning capability of a large vision-language model to conduct multi-objective evaluations across safety, comfort, and efficiency dimensions, leading to reasoned and human-aligned decision making. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM-v1 and NAVSIM-v2 benchmarks demonstrate that MindDrive achieves state-of-the-art performance across multi-dimensional driving metrics, significantly enhancing safety, compliance, and generalization. This work provides a promising path toward interpretable and cognitively guided autonomous driving.
