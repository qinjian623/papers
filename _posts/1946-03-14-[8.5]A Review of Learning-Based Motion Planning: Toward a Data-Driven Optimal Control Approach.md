## Reason for Interest

这是一篇高质量的自动驾驶运动规划综述，具有很强的前瞻性。1. **内容全面且前沿**：不仅涵盖了传统的模仿学习（IL）和强化学习（RL），还深入讨论了2024-2025年最热门的生成式AI方向（包括LLM、VLM、VLA、世界模型）在规划中的应用，引用文献极其新颖。2. **深度洞察**：文章批判性地分析了端到端“黑盒”模型在安全性和可解释性上的不足，并逻辑严密地论证了为何“数据驱动最优控制（DDPC）”是结合传统控制理论严谨性与AI适应性的理想路径。3. **行业价值**：针对当前自动驾驶从Demo向量产落地过程中面临的长尾场景和安全验证难题，提出的混合架构思路（Hybrid Learning + MPC）对工业界技术选型具有很高的参考价值。评分主要基于其对前沿技术的系统性梳理和对未来技术路线的建设性构想。
## Abstract: 
Motion planning for high-level autonomous driving is constrained by a fundamental trade-off between the transparent, yet brittle, nature of pipeline methods and the adaptive, yet opaque, "black-box" characteristics of modern learning-based systems. This paper critically synthesizes the evolution of the field -- from pipeline methods through imitation learning, reinforcement learning, and generative AI -- to demonstrate how this persistent dilemma has hindered the development of truly trustworthy systems. To resolve this impasse, we conduct a comprehensive review of learning-based motion planning methods. Based on this review, we outline a data-driven optimal control paradigm as a unifying framework that synergistically integrates the verifiable structure of classical control with the adaptive capacity of machine learning, leveraging real-world data to continuously refine key components such as system dynamics, cost functions, and safety constraints. We explore this framework's potential to enable three critical next-generation capabilities: "Human-Centric" customization, "Platform-Adaptive" dynamics adaptation, and "System Self-Optimization" via self-tuning. We conclude by proposing future research directions based on this paradigm, aimed at developing intelligent transportation systems that are simultaneously safe, interpretable, and capable of human-like autonomy.
