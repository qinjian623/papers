## Subfields
 3D感知 / 端侧模型加速 (无人机方向)
## Reason for Interest

1. 核心相关性低：该论文明确针对无人机（Drone）的'感知与避障'（SAD）场景设计。虽然使用了激光雷达（LiDAR），但其核心加速机制（利用时间维度的重复数据回收）依赖于传感器视角的相对静止或低动态变化（如无人机悬停）。
2. 适用性受限：在车端自动驾驶中，由于车辆高速运动导致自车坐标系下的背景和物体快速移动，'未变化区域'极少，导致该算法的数据回收机制失效。论文在PandaSet（车端数据集）的测试中承认了这一点，且指出该场景超出了方法的设计范围。
3. 技术局限：基础架构基于较老的PointPillars，精度远低于当前车端SOTA（如PillarNet）。
4. 评分理由：依据评分规则，非直接针对车端自动驾驶且技术迁移潜力有限的论文，分数限制在5分以内。尽管工程实现优秀，但对车端AD价值有限。
## Abstract: 
This work leverages the continuous sweeping motion of LiDAR scanning to concentrate object detection efforts on specific regions that receive a change in point data from one frame to another. We achieve this by using a sliding time window with short strides and consider the temporal dimension by storing convolution results between passes. This allows us to ignore unchanged regions, significantly reducing the number of convolution operations per forward pass without sacrificing accuracy. This data reuse scheme introduces extreme sparsity to detection data. To exploit this sparsity, we extend our previous work on scatter-based convolutions to allow for data reuse, and as such propose Sparse Scatter-Based Convolution Algorithm with Temporal Data Recycling (SSCATeR). This operation treats incoming LiDAR data as a continuous stream and acts only on the changing parts of the point cloud. By doing so, we achieve the same results with as much as a 6.61-fold reduction in processing time. Our test results show that the feature maps output by our method are identical to those produced by traditional sparse convolution techniques, whilst greatly increasing the computational efficiency of the network.
