## Reason for Interest

论文独辟蹊径，利用合成数据生成技术解决真实数据中难以解耦“物体”与“背景”相关性的痛点，系统性地研究了背景偏差（Background Correlation）对自动驾驶感知模型（交通标志识别）的影响。创新性在于提出了一套基于受控合成数据的XAI评估框架，定量验证了Saliency Methods（如SHAP, GradCAM）在检测模型“虚假相关性”时的有效性。虽然实验仅限于2D交通标志分类，尚未推广到复杂的3D感知任务，但其严谨的实验设计为自动驾驶模型的安全性验证和可解释性分析提供了有价值的方法论支撑。
## Abstract: 
Common approaches to explainable AI (XAI) for deep learning focus on analyzing the importance of input features on the classification task in a given model: saliency methods like SHAP and GradCAM are used to measure the impact of spatial regions of the input image on the classification result. Combined with ground truth information about the location of the object in the input image (e.g., a binary mask), it is determined whether object pixels had a high impact on the classification result, or whether the classification focused on background pixels. The former is considered to be a sign of a healthy classifier, whereas the latter is assumed to suggest overfitting on spurious correlations. A major challenge, however, is that these intuitive interpretations are difficult to test quantitatively, and hence the output of such explanations lacks an explanation itself. One particular reason is that correlations in real-world data are difficult to avoid, and whether they are spurious or legitimate is debatable. Synthetic data in turn can facilitate to actively enable or disable correlations where desired but often lack a sufficient quantification of realism and stochastic properties. [...] Therefore, we systematically generate six synthetic datasets for the task of traffic sign recognition, which differ only in their degree of camera variation and background correlation [...] to quantify the isolated influence of background correlation, different levels of camera variation, and considered traffic sign shapes on the classification performance, as well as background feature importance. [...] Results include a quantification of when and how much background features gain importance to support the classification task based on changes in the training domain [...].
