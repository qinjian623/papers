## Reason for Interest

论文针对立体匹配（Stereo Matching）系统的物理对抗攻击提出了创新方案。不同于传统的2D贴图攻击容易因左右视图视差不一致而失效，该文提出了一种立体对齐的3D渲染模块（Stereo-Aligned 3D Rendering），确保对抗纹理在双目视角下的几何一致性。提出的'Merging Attack'策略能有效地将目标物体隐入背景深度。实验部分包含数字仿真（CARLA）、1:30比例的物理模型验证以及Baidu Apollo系统的端到端攻击测试，论证逻辑严密，实验结果显著优于现有基线方法（PASM, Adv-DM），揭示了基于立体视觉的深度感知系统在物理对抗下的脆弱性，具有较高的安全研究价值。
## Abstract: 
Though deep neural models adopted to realize the perception of autonomous driving have proven vulnerable to adversarial examples, known attacks often leverage 2D patches and target mostly monocular perception. Therefore, the effectiveness of Physical Adversarial Examples (PAEs) on stereo-based binocular depth estimation remains largely unexplored. To this end, we propose the first texture-enabled physical adversarial attack against stereo matching models in the context of autonomous driving. Our method employs a 3D PAE with global camouflage texture rather than a local 2D patch-based one, ensuring both visual consistency and attack effectiveness across different viewpoints of stereo cameras. To cope with the disparity effect of these cameras, we also propose a new 3D stereo matching rendering module that allows the PAE to be aligned with real-world positions and headings in binocular vision. We further propose a novel merging attack that seamlessly blends the target into the environment through fine-grained PAE optimization. It has significantly enhanced stealth and lethality upon existing hiding attacks that fail to get seamlessly merged into the background. Extensive evaluations show that our PAEs can successfully fool the stereo models into producing erroneous depth information.
