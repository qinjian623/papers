## Subfields
 LiDAR Semantic Segmentation / Perception in Adverse Weather
## Reason for Interest

The paper addresses a critical safety issue in autonomous driving: LiDAR perception degradation in adverse weather (rain, fog, snow). 

1. **Innovation**: The proposed 'Light Geometry-aware adapter' creatively uses local-window KNN with circular padding (handling the 360° LiDAR seam) to extract geometric cues (offsets, dispersion). These cues intelligently guide a learnable point drop policy to target structurally fragile areas (boundaries, corners) rather than just random noise, which is physically grounded and logical.

2. **Performance**: The method demonstrates robust improvements, particularly in safety-critical classes (Car, Bus, Person) and boundary preservation (reducing bus-building confusion). However, the absolute gain over the top competing method ('No Thing, Nothing') is quite marginal (39.15% vs 38.90%), suggesting the performance ceiling for this specific transfer task might be approaching.

3. **Evaluation**: Testing on SemanticSTF (real adverse weather data) is valuable. However, the evaluation is limited to a single transfer scenario (SemanticKITTI → SemanticSTF). Broader validation on other datasets (e.g., Waymo, nuScenes) would strengthen the claims.

4. **Relevance**: The source-only setting is highly practical for deploying AVs in new environments without expensive relabeling.
