## Reason for Interest

1. 权威性与价值：这是由nuScenes数据集原始作者团队撰写的深度回顾与综述论文，引用了直到2024/2025年的最新工作（如nuPlan, SparseLIF, OmniDrive等），极具参考价值。
2. 技术深度：不同于普通综述，本文披露了大量关于数据集构建的未公开技术细节，例如激光雷达与相机的详细时间同步分析（Time offset histogram）、地图对齐误差（Map misalignment）以及数据划分（Splits）背后的设计权衡。这些对于深入理解数据特性和排查工程问题至关重要。
3. 批判性分析：文章诚恳地讨论了nuScenes设计的优缺点（如缺乏Z轴定位信息、部分场景过短等），并对比了Waymo、Argoverse 2等后续数据集，为未来的数据集构建提供了指导。
4. 行业潜力：作为自动驾驶领域引用率最高的数据集之一的官方“续作”/说明书，该论文将成为使用该数据集进行感知道路和端到端规划研究的重要参考文献。
## Abstract: 
Autonomous Vehicles (AV) and Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) have been revolutionized by Deep Learning. As a data-driven approach, Deep Learning relies on vast amounts of driving data, typically labeled in great detail. As a result, datasets, alongside hardware and algorithms, are foundational building blocks for the development of AVs. In this work we revisit one of the most widely used autonomous driving datasets: the nuScenes dataset. nuScenes exemplifies key trends in AV development, being the first dataset to include radar data, to feature diverse urban driving scenes from two continents, and to be collected using a fully autonomous vehicle operating on public roads, while also promoting multi-modal sensor fusion, standardized benchmarks, and a broad range of tasks including perception, localization \& mapping, prediction and planning. We provide an unprecedented look into the creation of nuScenes, as well as its extensions nuImages and Panoptic nuScenes, summarizing many technical details that have hitherto not been revealed in academic publications. Furthermore, we trace how the influence of nuScenes impacted a large number of other datasets that were released later and how it defined numerous standards that are used by the community to this day. Finally, we present an overview of both official and unofficial tasks using the nuScenes dataset and review major methodological developments, thereby offering a comprehensive survey of the autonomous driving literature, with a particular focus on nuScenes.
