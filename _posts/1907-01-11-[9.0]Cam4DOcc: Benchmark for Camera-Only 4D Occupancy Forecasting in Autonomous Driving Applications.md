## Subfields
 3D感知 / 4D占用栅格预测 (Occupancy Forecasting)
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性与行业价值（9/10）：论文切中了当前自动驾驶感知的核心痛点——从‘感知当前’向‘预测未来’演进，且聚焦于纯视觉（Camera-only）方案，具有极高的应用价值。提出的Cam4DOcc填补了纯视觉4D Occupancy预测基准的空白。
2. 方法论（8.5/10）：不仅定义了数据集和评估指标，还针对性地设计了四个梯度的任务（从动态物体到全场景细粒度）。提出的OCFNet通过端到端的方式同时预测占用状态和3D向后向心流（3D backward centripetal flow），设计合理且有效。
3. 实验完整性（9/10）：实验基于nuScenes和Lyft-Level5两大主流数据集，构建了四种不同范式的基线（静态假设、点云预测体素化、2D-3D提升、端到端）进行详尽对比，消融实验充分，结果可信。
4. 综合评价：这是一篇高质量的Benchmark类论文，为该细分领域设立了标准，代码开源进一步提升了其影响力，非常适合作为自动驾驶预测感知方向的重要参考。
## Abstract: 
Understanding how the surrounding environment changes is crucial for performing downstream tasks safely and reliably in autonomous driving applications. Recent occupancy estimation techniques using only camera images as input can provide dense occupancy representations of large-scale scenes based on the current observation. However, they are mostly limited to representing the current 3D space and do not consider the future state of surrounding objects along the time axis. To extend camera-only occupancy estimation into spatiotemporal prediction, we propose Cam4DOcc, a new benchmark for camera-only 4D occupancy forecasting, evaluating the surrounding scene changes in a near future. We build our benchmark based on multiple publicly available datasets, including nuScenes, nuScenes-Occupancy, and Lyft-Level5, which provides sequential occupancy states of general movable and static objects, as well as their 3D backward centripetal flow. To establish this benchmark for future research with comprehensive comparisons, we introduce four baseline types from diverse camera-based perception and prediction implementations, including a static-world occupancy model, voxelization of point cloud prediction, 2D-3D instance-based prediction, and our proposed novel end-to-end 4D occupancy forecasting network. Furthermore, the standardized evaluation protocol for preset multiple tasks is also provided to compare the performance of all the proposed baselines on present and future occupancy estimation with respect to objects of interest in autonomous driving scenarios. The dataset and our implementation of all four baselines in the proposed Cam4DOcc benchmark will be released here: https://github.com/haomo-ai/Cam4DOcc.
