## Subfields
 3D感知 / 视频4D目标检测 (Open-Set)
## Reason for Interest

该论文在自动驾驶感知领域具有较高价值，主要贡献在于：1. 提出了一个大规模的统一4D检测数据集DA4D，弥补了现有数据集在时序标注上的不足；2. 设计了DetAny4D框架，结合基础模型（SAM, DINO）与因果时空注意力机制，实现了端到端的开集（Open-Set）视频3D检测；3. 实验表明该方法在保证精度的同时显著降低了帧间检测抖动（Temporal Jitter），这是目前纯视觉BEV/3D检测在落地中的痛点。虽然未直接与闭集SOTA（如StreamPETR等）进行全面对比，但在开集和稳定性方向创新性强。
## Abstract: 
Reliable 4D object detection, which refers to 3D object detection in streaming video, is crucial for perceiving and understanding the real world. Existing open-set 4D object detection methods typically make predictions on a frame-by-frame basis without modeling temporal consistency, or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines that are prone to error propagation across cascaded stages. Progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of large-scale datasets that capture continuous reliable 3D bounding box (b-box) annotations. To overcome these challenges, we first introduce DA4D, a large-scale 4D detection dataset containing over 280k sequences with high-quality b-box annotations collected under diverse conditions. Building on DA4D, we propose DetAny4D, an open-set end-to-end framework that predicts 3D b-boxes directly from sequential inputs. DetAny4D fuses multi-modal features from pre-trained foundational models and designs a geometry-aware spatiotemporal decoder to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. Furthermore, it adopts a multi-task learning architecture coupled with a dedicated training strategy to maintain global consistency across sequences of varying lengths. Extensive experiments show that DetAny4D achieves competitive detection accuracy and significantly improves temporal stability, effectively addressing long-standing issues of jitter and inconsistency in 4D object detection. Data and code will be released upon acceptance.
