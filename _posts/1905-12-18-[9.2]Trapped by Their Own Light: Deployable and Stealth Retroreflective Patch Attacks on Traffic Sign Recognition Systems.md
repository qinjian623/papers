## Reason for Interest

该论文在自动驾驶感知安全领域具有显著的创新性和实用价值。主要亮点包括：1. **创新性**：利用逆反射材料（Retroreflective Material）的物理特性，设计了一种仅在夜间被车灯照射时触发、白天具备高隐蔽性的对抗性贴纸攻击（ARP），巧妙解决了传统Patch攻击隐蔽性差和激光投射攻击部署难的痛点。2. **实验完整性**：建立了基于物理光学的Blender逆反射仿真模型用于优化攻击参数，并在数字仿真、物理静态场景、以及动态驾驶场景（针对YOLOv5/Faster R-CNN及两款商用车型）中进行了全方位验证。3. **可信度与影响力**：直接攻破了商用车的量产TSR系统，证明了该威胁的真实存在。同时进行了大规模用户研究验证其隐蔽性，并提出了一种基于偏振光的物理防御方案（DPR Shield），形成了完整的攻防闭环。
## Abstract: 
Traffic sign recognition plays a critical role in ensuring safe and efficient transportation of autonomous vehicles but remain vulnerable to adversarial attacks using stickers or laser projections. While existing attack vectors demonstrate security concerns, they suffer from visual detectability or implementation constraints, suggesting unexplored vulnerability surfaces in TSR systems. We introduce the Adversarial Retroreflective Patch (ARP), a novel attack vector that combines the high deployability of patch attacks with the stealthiness of laser projections by utilizing retroreflective materials activated only under victim headlight illumination. We develop a retroreflection simulation method and employ black-box optimization to maximize attack effectiveness. ARP achieves $\geq$93.4\% success rate in dynamic scenarios at 35 meters and $\geq$60\% success rate against commercial TSR systems in real-world conditions. Our user study demonstrates that ARP attacks maintain near-identical stealthiness to benign signs while achieving $\geq$1.9\% higher stealthiness scores than previous patch attacks. We propose the DPR Shield defense, employing strategically placed polarized filters, which achieves $\geq$75\% defense success rates for stop signs and speed limit signs against micro-prism patches.
