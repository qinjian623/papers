## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种名为ShelfGaussian的框架，创新性地结合了多模态传感器输入、3D高斯（3DGS）表示和现成的视觉基础模型（VFMs）来实现开放词汇的3D场景理解。其核心贡献在于设计了‘货架监督’（Shelf-Supervised）学习范式，利用VFM在2D图像和3D场景级别同时进行特征对齐，并开发了支持高维特征反向传播的高效CUDA加速G2V（Gaussian-to-Voxel）模块。实验不仅在公开数据集Occ3D-nuScenes上取得了零样本任务的SOTA，还在真实的无人车（UGV）上展示了优秀的泛化能力和长尾物体识别能力。此外，论文还初步探索了基于高斯表示的轨迹规划，虽然规划部分相对基础，但整体工作完整度高，对自动驾驶中处理长尾和未见物体的感知问题具有重要的参考价值。
## Abstract: 
We introduce ShelfGaussian, an open-vocabulary multi-modal Gaussian-based 3D scene understanding framework supervised by off-the-shelf vision foundation models (VFMs). Gaussian-based methods have demonstrated superior performance and computational efficiency across a wide range of scene understanding tasks. However, existing methods either model objects as closed-set semantic Gaussians supervised by annotated 3D labels, neglecting their rendering ability, or learn open-set Gaussian representations via purely 2D self-supervision, leading to degraded geometry and limited to camera-only settings. To fully exploit the potential of Gaussians, we propose a Multi-Modal Gaussian Transformer that enables Gaussians to query features from diverse sensor modalities, and a Shelf-Supervised Learning Paradigm that efficiently optimizes Gaussians with VFM features jointly at 2D image and 3D scene levels. We evaluate ShelfGaussian on various perception and planning tasks. Experiments on Occ3D-nuScenes demonstrate its state-of-the-art zero-shot semantic occupancy prediction performance. ShelfGaussian is further evaluated on an unmanned ground vehicle (UGV) to assess its in the-wild performance across diverse urban scenarios.
