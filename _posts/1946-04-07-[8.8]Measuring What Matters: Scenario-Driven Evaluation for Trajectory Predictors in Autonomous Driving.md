## Subfields
 轨迹预测 / 评测方法与仿真 (Trajectory Prediction / Evaluation)
## Reason for Interest

1. 痛点精准：直击自动驾驶预测领域的关键难题，即传统指标（ADE/FDE）优异的模型未必能带来更好的驾驶体验（Planner Misalignment）。
2. 创新性强：提出了场景自适应的评测理念（ED-Eva），利用 ScenarioNN 动态调整“准确性”与“多样性”的权重，并提出了基于 GMM 面积的 GAD 指标来量化多样性，方法论设计合理且贴合实际。
3. 实验扎实：摒弃了纯开环评测，构建了包含 Frenet Planner 的闭环仿真基准，在 nuScenes 真实数据集上验证了评测指标与规划性能的高度一致性。
4. 行业价值：对于解决预测模型“刷榜无效”的工业界落地问题具有极高的指导意义。
## Abstract: 
Being able to anticipate the motion of surrounding agents is essential for the safe operation of autonomous driving systems in dynamic situations. While various methods have been proposed for trajectory prediction, the current evaluation practices still rely on error-based metrics (e.g., ADE, FDE), which reveal the accuracy from a post-hoc view but ignore the actual effect the predictor brings to the self-driving vehicles (SDVs), especially in complex interactive scenarios: a high-quality predictor not only chases accuracy, but should also captures all possible directions a neighbor agent might move, to support the SDVs' cautious decision-making. Given that the existing metrics hardly account for this standard, in our work, we propose a comprehensive pipeline that adaptively evaluates the predictor's performance by two dimensions: accuracy and diversity. Based on the criticality of the driving scenario, these two dimensions are dynamically combined and result in a final score for the predictor's performance. Extensive experiments on a closed-loop benchmark using real-world datasets show that our pipeline yields a more reasonable evaluation than traditional metrics by better reflecting the correlation of the predictors' evaluation with the autonomous vehicles' driving performance. This evaluation pipeline shows a robust way to select a predictor that potentially contributes most to the SDV's driving performance.
