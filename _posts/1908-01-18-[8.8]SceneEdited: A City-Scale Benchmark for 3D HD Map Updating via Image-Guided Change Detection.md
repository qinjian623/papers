## Reason for Interest

论文解决了自动驾驶中极具商业价值且研究较少的痛点——高精地图（HD Map）的低成本自动化更新。现有的研究多集中于'变化检测'，而本文进一步推动至'地图几何更新'（Point Cloud Map Updating）。

主要贡献与亮点：
1. **首个城市级地图更新数据集**：基于Argoverse构建，通过自动化和人工手段合成“过时”场景（添加/删除物体），填补了该领域缺乏公开大规模评测数据的空白。
2. **任务定义明确**：将地图更新细分为点云添加（Point Addition）和删除（Point Deletion），并提供了完整的评估指标和工具包（Toolkit）。
3. **实验分析深入**：利用最新的图像到3D（Image-to-3D）模型（如DUSt3R, MASt3R）作为基线进行评估，指出了当前视觉重建方法在地图级几何精度上的不足，为后续研究指明了方向。

鉴于高精地图鲜度是L4级自动驾驶落地的核心瓶颈之一，该数据集和Benchmark具有极高的行业价值和学术潜力。
## Abstract: 
Accurate, up-to-date High-Definition (HD) maps are critical for urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, and autonomous navigation. However, these maps quickly become outdated as environments evolve, creating a need for robust methods that not only detect changes but also incorporate them into updated 3D representations. While change detection techniques have advanced significantly, there remains a clear gap between detecting changes and actually updating 3D maps, particularly when relying on 2D image-based change detection. To address this gap, we introduce SceneEdited, the first city-scale dataset explicitly designed to support research on HD map maintenance through 3D point cloud updating. SceneEdited contains over 800 up-to-date scenes covering 73 km of driving and approximate 3 $\text{km}^2$ of urban area, with more than 23,000 synthesized object changes created both manually and automatically across 2000+ out-of-date versions, simulating realistic urban modifications such as missing roadside infrastructure, buildings, overpasses, and utility poles. Each scene includes calibrated RGB images, LiDAR scans, and detailed change masks for training and evaluation. We also provide baseline methods using a foundational image-based structure-from-motion pipeline for updating outdated scenes, as well as a comprehensive toolkit supporting scalability, trackability, and portability for future dataset expansion and unification of out-of-date object annotations. Both the dataset and the toolkit are publicly available at https://github.com/ChadLin9596/ScenePoint-ETK, establising a standardized benchmark for 3D map updating research.
