## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种创新的‘以激光雷达为中心’的多模态融合框架（BEVDilation）。其核心贡献在于解决相机深度估计误差导致的融合错位问题，通过将图像特征作为‘引导’而非直接拼接，利用 SVDB（结合 Mamba 状态空间模型）和 SBDB（语义引导的可变形卷积）来致密化稀疏的激光雷达特征。实验结果表明，该方法在 nuScenes 数据集上取得了新的 SOTA 性能，并且在应对深度噪声和外参标定误差时表现出比 BEVFusion 更强的鲁棒性。论文逻辑清晰，实验详实（包含 Waymo 泛化性验证），对自动驾驶高精度感知具有较高的参考价值。
## Abstract: 
Integrating LiDAR and camera information in the bird's eye view (BEV) representation has demonstrated its effectiveness in 3D object detection. However, because of the fundamental disparity in geometric accuracy between these sensors, indiscriminate fusion in previous methods often leads to degraded performance. In this paper, we propose BEVDilation, a novel LiDAR-centric framework that prioritizes LiDAR information in the fusion. By formulating image BEV features as implicit guidance rather than naive concatenation, our strategy effectively alleviates the spatial misalignment caused by image depth estimation errors. Furthermore, the image guidance can effectively help the LiDAR-centric paradigm to address the sparsity and semantic limitations of point clouds. Specifically, we propose a Sparse Voxel Dilation Block that mitigates the inherent point sparsity by densifying foreground voxels through image priors. Moreover, we introduce a Semantic-Guided BEV Dilation Block to enhance the LiDAR feature diffusion processing with image semantic guidance and long-range context capture. On the challenging nuScenes benchmark, BEVDilation achieves better performance than state-of-the-art methods while maintaining competitive computational efficiency. Importantly, our LiDAR-centric strategy demonstrates greater robustness to depth noise compared to naive fusion. The source code is available at https://github.com/gwenzhang/BEVDilation.
