## Subfields
 Roadside Perception (V2X) / LiDAR Background Subtraction
## Reason for Interest

1. **Scope Limitation**: The paper addresses infrastructure-side (roadside) perception. While beneficial for V2X, it is not a direct vehicle-side autonomous driving algorithm. Per instructions, the score is capped at 5.
2. **Methodology**: It proposes a traditional statistical background subtraction method (Gaussian Distribution Grid). While 'interpretable' and adaptable to different sensor types (MEMS/Rotating), it lacks the advanced capabilities of modern deep learning-based 3D perception pipelines.
3. **Evaluation**: Validation is performed on the public RCooper dataset with practical deployment tests on Jetson Nano. However, the comparative analysis is limited to a single traditional baseline, lacking comparison with learning-based approaches that represent the broader state-of-the-art in point cloud processing.
