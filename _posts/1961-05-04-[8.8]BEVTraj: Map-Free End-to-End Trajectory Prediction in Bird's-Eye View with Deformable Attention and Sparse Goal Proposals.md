## Subfields
 Trajectory Prediction / Map-Free Perception
## Reason for Interest

The paper addresses a critical industry pain point (reliance on expensive HD maps) by proposing a map-free, end-to-end trajectory prediction framework (BEVTraj) operating directly from sensor data. The proposed Sparse Goal Candidate Proposal (SGCP) and use of deformable attention in BEV space are innovative. Experiments are comprehensive across two major datasets (nuScenes, Argoverse 2), showing that the method not only eliminates map dependency but also surpasses strong map-based baselines (like MTR) on key safety metrics like Miss Rate. The inclusion of open-source code further enhances credibility.
