## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种基于物理渲染（PBR）的高保真汽车LiDAR模拟方法，核心创新在于利用实验室测量的光束强度分布和接收器灵敏度来参数化传感器模型，从而精确模拟“泛光（Blooming）”等光学伪影。这种方法对于生成高反射率场景（如交通标志、车牌）的Corner Case数据具有重要价值，有助于提升感知算法的鲁棒性。然而，该方法计算成本较高（单帧需数秒），难以满足实时的硬件在环（HiL）测试需求；且实验主要基于定性对比，缺乏大规模数据集上的定量下游任务（如目标检测性能提升）验证。虽然属于仿真细分领域，但物理建模的深度使其具备较高的行业参考价值。
## Abstract: 
We present an analytic model for simulating automotive time-of-flight (ToF) LiDAR that includes blooming, echo pulse width, and ambient light, along with steps to determine model parameters systematically through optical laboratory measurements. The model uses physically based rendering (PBR) in the near-infrared domain. It assumes single-bounce reflections and retroreflections over rasterized rendered images from shading or ray tracing, including light emitted from the sensor as well as stray light from other, non-correlated sources such as sunlight. Beams from the sensor and sensitivity of the receiving diodes are modeled with flexible beam steering patterns and with non-vanishing diameter.
  Different (all non-real time) computational approaches can be chosen based on system properties, computing capabilities, and desired output properties.
  Model parameters include system-specific properties, namely the physical spread of the LiDAR beam, combined with the sensitivity of the receiving diode; the intensity of the emitted light; the conversion between the intensity of reflected light and the echo pulse width; and scenario parameters such as environment lighting, positioning, and surface properties of the target(s) in the relevant infrared domain. System-specific properties of the model are determined from laboratory measurements of the photometric luminance on different target surfaces aligned with a goniometer at 0.01{\deg} resolution, which marks the best available resolution for measuring the beam pattern.
  The approach is calibrated for and tested on two automotive LiDAR systems, the Valeo Scala Gen. 2 and the Blickfeld Cube 1. Both systems differ notably in their properties and available interfaces, but the relevant model parameters could be extracted successfully.
