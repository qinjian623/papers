论文提出了一种基于可微分仿真器（Waymax）的测试时规划框架（DSS）。其核心创新在于利用仿真器的可微性，在推理阶段通过梯度下降直接优化动作序列，并结合分类器引导（Classifier-Guidance）处理不可微的碰撞/越野约束。这种方法将学习到的策略作为先验，通过测试时计算（Search + Optimization）显著提升了轨迹质量。实验结果表明，在长视场规划任务中，相比传统的模仿学习和离线RL方法，该方法大幅降低了位置误差，具有很高的学术价值和应用潜力。
## Abstract: 
Planning allows an agent to safely refine its actions before executing them in the real world. In autonomous driving, this is crucial to avoid collisions and navigate in complex, dense traffic scenarios. One way to plan is to search for the best action sequence. However, this is challenging when all necessary components - policy, next-state predictor, and critic - have to be learned. Here we propose Differentiable Simulation for Search (DSS), a framework that leverages the differentiable simulator Waymax as both a next state predictor and a critic. It relies on the simulator's hardcoded dynamics, making state predictions highly accurate, while utilizing the simulator's differentiability to effectively search across action sequences. Our DSS agent optimizes its actions using gradient descent over imagined future trajectories. We show experimentally that DSS - the combination of planning gradients and stochastic search - significantly improves tracking and path planning accuracy compared to sequence prediction, imitation learning, model-free RL, and other planning methods.
