## Subfields
 V2X / 车路协同感知 (Vehicle-Infrastructure Cooperative Perception)
## Reason for Interest

1. 论文定位：这是一篇关于6G通信网络与具身智能融合的综述与愿景论文（Review），核心在于提出“具身智能基站代理（IBSA）”架构，即利用大模型（LAM）在基站端（Infrastructure-side）进行感知、通信与计算的融合。
2. 创新性：提出了将基站转化为具备感知和行动能力的智能体的概念，整合了通感算（ISAC）与大模型，具有一定的前瞻性。
3. 实验与验证：论文并未提出具体的车端感知算法或在公开数据集上进行原创性的SOTA对比实验。文中的性能对比（如图5、图6）明确标注数据来源于参考文献[25]（V2X-Radar dataset），仅用于论证车路协同的必要性，而非展示本论文模型的性能。
4. 评分依据：虽然论文涉及自动驾驶的车路协同场景，但其研究主体是通信基础设施（6G基站），属于“路端/网端”技术，而非直接运行于自动驾驶车辆上的“车端（On-board）”算法。根据评分规则“如果不直接和车端自动驾驶相关，最多 5分”，且缺乏实质性的算法实验验证，故给出4.2分。
## Abstract: 
The advent of sixth-generation (6G) places intelligence at the core of wireless architecture, fusing perception, communication, and computation into a single closed-loop. This paper argues that large artificial intelligence models (LAMs) can endow base stations with perception, reasoning, and acting capabilities, thus transforming them into intelligent base station agents (IBSAs). We first review the historical evolution of BSs from single-functional analog infrastructure to distributed, software-defined, and finally LAM-empowered IBSA, highlighting the accompanying changes in architecture, hardware platforms, and deployment. We then present an IBSA architecture that couples a perception-cognition-execution pipeline with cloud-edge-end collaboration and parameter-efficient adaptation. Subsequently,we study two representative scenarios: (i) cooperative vehicle-road perception for autonomous driving, and (ii) ubiquitous base station support for low-altitude uncrewed aerial vehicle safety monitoring and response against unauthorized drones. On this basis, we analyze key enabling technologies spanning LAM design and training, efficient edge-cloud inference, multi-modal perception and actuation, as well as trustworthy security and governance. We further propose a holistic evaluation framework and benchmark considerations that jointly cover communication performance, perception accuracy, decision-making reliability, safety, and energy efficiency. Finally, we distill open challenges on benchmarks, continual adaptation, trustworthy decision-making, and standardization. Together, this work positions LAM-enabled IBSAs as a practical path toward integrated perception, communication, and computation native, safety-critical 6G systems.
