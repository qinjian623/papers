## Subfields
 Planning & Control / Social Navigation
## Reason for Interest

The paper presents a high-quality methodology (CoRL 2025) using compositional diffusion models for instruction-following navigation, showing strong improvements over VLM baselines. However, the work is strictly positioned in the domain of 'Social Robot Navigation' (service robots, low-speed pedestrian interaction, Clearpath Jackal platform) rather than vehicle-end autonomous driving. It relies on custom simulation/campus scenarios rather than standard AD benchmarks (nuScenes, Waymo). While the diffusion planning approach has theoretical transferability to AD trajectory generation, the specific application and validation do not meet the strict 'direct vehicle-end AD' criteria for a score > 5.
