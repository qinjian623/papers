## Subfields
 感知安全评估 / 仿真测试 (Perception Safety Evaluation / Simulation Testing)
## Reason for Interest

1. **创新性与切入点 (8/10)**：论文直击自动驾驶行业痛点——传统计算机视觉指标（Precision/Recall）无法真实反映感知系统的“安全性”。提出结合目标检测（Object）与车道检测（Lane）的联合评估方法，并引入任务依赖性（Interdependence）和基于人体伤害模型（Injury Severity）的严重度评估，逻辑严密且具有新意。
2. **实验与论证 (7.5/10)**：使用专门针对事故场景的 DeepAccident 数据集进行验证，展示了该指标在安全边界场景（Corner Cases）下的敏感性。虽然主要依赖统计传感器模型和仿真数据进行验证，对于评估“指标”本身的有效性是合理的，但缺乏在真实路测大规模数据上的分布验证。
3. **行业价值 (8/10)**：对于自动驾驶系统的测试验证（V&V）环节具有很高的参考价值。该方法提供了一种将感知质量转化为可解释的安全分数的手段，有助于弥补开发与部署之间的安全鸿沟。
4. **局限性**：方法中涉及较多的人工设计参数（如各类阈值、加权系数等），在跨不同运行设计域（ODD）时可能需要复杂的参数调优，通用性有待进一步证明。
## Abstract: 
Extensive evaluation of perception systems is crucial for ensuring the safety of intelligent vehicles in complex driving scenarios. Conventional performance metrics such as precision, recall and the F1-score assess the overall detection accuracy, but they do not consider the safety-relevant aspects of perception. Consequently, perception systems that achieve high scores in these metrics may still cause misdetections that could lead to severe accidents. Therefore, it is important to evaluate not only the overall performance of perception systems, but also their safety. We therefore introduce a novel safety metric for jointly evaluating the most critical perception tasks, object and lane detection. Our proposed framework integrates a new, lightweight object safety metric that quantifies the potential risk associated with object detection errors, as well as an lane safety metric including the interdependence between both tasks that can occur in safety evaluation. The resulting combined safety score provides a unified, interpretable measure of perception safety performance. Using the DeepAccident dataset, we demonstrate that our approach identifies safety critical perception errors that conventional performance metrics fail to capture. Our findings emphasize the importance of safety-centric evaluation methods for perception systems in autonomous driving.
