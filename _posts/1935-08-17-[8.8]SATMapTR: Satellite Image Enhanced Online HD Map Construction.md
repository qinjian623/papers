## Subfields
 Online HD Map Construction / Satellite-Camera Fusion
## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种利用卫星图像增强在线高精地图构建的方法，通过 Gated Feature Refinement 和 Geometry-Aware Fusion 模块有效解决了卫星图像噪声和融合对齐问题。实验结果非常惊人，仅利用 Camera+Satellite 就超越了 Camera+LiDAR 的 SOTA 性能，特别是在长距离感知和恶劣天气（雨雾遮挡）场景下表现出极强的鲁棒性。这种利用先验（卫星图）补充实时感知盲区的思路对工业界落地具有很高的参考价值，虽然依赖高精度卫星图和定位，但在 HD Map 建图任务中是合理的假设。
## Abstract: 
High-definition (HD) maps are evolving from pre-annotated to real-time construction to better support autonomous driving in diverse scenarios. However, this process is hindered by low-quality input data caused by onboard sensors limited capability and frequent occlusions, leading to incomplete, noisy, or missing data, and thus reduced mapping accuracy and robustness. Recent efforts have introduced satellite images as auxiliary input, offering a stable, wide-area view to complement the limited ego perspective. However, satellite images in Bird's Eye View are often degraded by shadows and occlusions from vegetation and buildings. Prior methods using basic feature extraction and fusion remain ineffective. To address these challenges, we propose SATMapTR, a novel online map construction model that effectively fuses satellite image through two key components: (1) a gated feature refinement module that adaptively filters satellite image features by integrating high-level semantics with low-level structural cues to extract high signal-to-noise ratio map-relevant representations; and (2) a geometry-aware fusion module that consistently fuse satellite and BEV features at a grid-to-grid level, minimizing interference from irrelevant regions and low-quality inputs. Experimental results on the nuScenes dataset show that SATMapTR achieves the highest mean average precision (mAP) of 73.8, outperforming state-of-the-art satellite-enhanced models by up to 14.2 mAP. It also shows lower mAP degradation under adverse weather and sensor failures, and achieves nearly 3 times higher mAP at extended perception ranges.
