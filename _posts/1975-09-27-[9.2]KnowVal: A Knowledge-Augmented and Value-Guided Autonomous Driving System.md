## Subfields
 端到端自动驾驶 / 知识驱动规划 (End-to-End Autonomous Driving / Knowledge-Driven Planning)
## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种新颖的 KnowVal 系统，通过结合构建的驾驶知识图谱（包含法规、防御性驾驶原则等）和价值模型（Value Model）来增强端到端规划的可解释性和安全性。主要亮点包括：
1. 创新性强：将开放世界感知、RAG（检索增强生成）与自动驾驶规划深度融合，利用 Value Model 对轨迹进行符合人类价值观的评分，解决了传统 E2E 模型缺乏显式推理能力的痛点。
2. 实验扎实：在极具挑战性的闭环 Bench2Drive 榜单上取得了显著的 SOTA 成绩，且在 nuScenes 上显著降低了碰撞率，证明了方法的有效性和安全性。
3. 方法论完善：构建了包含 160K 轨迹-知识对的偏好数据集用于训练 Value Model，逻辑闭环清晰。
## Abstract: 
Visual-language reasoning, driving knowledge, and value alignment are essential for advanced autonomous driving systems. However, existing approaches largely rely on data-driven learning, making it difficult to capture the complex logic underlying decision-making through imitation or limited reinforcement rewards. To address this, we propose KnowVal, a new autonomous driving system that enables visual-language reasoning through the synergistic integration of open-world perception and knowledge retrieval. Specifically, we construct a comprehensive driving knowledge graph that encodes traffic laws, defensive driving principles, and ethical norms, complemented by an efficient LLM-based retrieval mechanism tailored for driving scenarios. Furthermore, we develop a human-preference dataset and train a Value Model to guide interpretable, value-aligned trajectory assessment. Experimental results show that our method substantially improves planning performance while remaining compatible with existing architectures. Notably, KnowVal achieves the lowest collision rate on nuScenes and state-of-the-art results on Bench2Drive.
