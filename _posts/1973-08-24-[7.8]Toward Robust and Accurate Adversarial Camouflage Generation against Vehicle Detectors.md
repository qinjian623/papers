## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种名为RAUCA的物理对抗伪装生成框架，针对自动驾驶车辆检测器的鲁棒性问题进行了深入研究。核心创新在于提出了E2E-NRP（端到端神经渲染器Plus），解决了传统方法无法在渲染过程中准确捕捉环境特征（如天气、光照）及纹理映射不精确的问题。论文构建了多天气数据集以增强攻击鲁棒性。实验部分在CARLA仿真环境和1:12比例模型实物上进行了验证，展示了其在多种天气和视角下的攻击有效性优于现有方法（如ACTIVE, FCA）。虽然方法创新性较好且代码开源，但实物验证仅基于玩具级比例模型而非真车，在工业级落地的说服力上略有欠缺，因此综合评分7.8。
## Abstract: 
Adversarial camouflage is a widely used physical attack against vehicle detectors for its superiority in multi-view attack performance. One promising approach involves using differentiable neural renderers to facilitate adversarial camouflage optimization through gradient back-propagation. However, existing methods often struggle to capture environmental characteristics during the rendering process or produce adversarial textures that can precisely map to the target vehicle. Moreover, these approaches neglect diverse weather conditions, reducing the efficacy of generated camouflage across varying weather scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and accurate camouflage generation method, namely RAUCA. The core of RAUCA is a novel neural rendering component, End-to-End Neural Renderer Plus (E2E-NRP), which can accurately optimize and project vehicle textures and render images with environmental characteristics such as lighting and weather. In addition, we integrate a multi-weather dataset for camouflage generation, leveraging the E2E-NRP to enhance the attack robustness. Experimental results on six popular object detectors show that RAUCA-final outperforms existing methods in both simulation and real-world settings.
