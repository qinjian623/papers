## Abstract: 
V2X prediction can alleviate perception incompleteness caused by limited line of sight through fusing trajectory data from infrastructure and vehicles, which is crucial to traffic safety and efficiency. However, in dense traffic scenarios, frequent identity switching of targets hinders cross-view association and fusion. Meanwhile, multi-source information tends to generate redundant interactions during the encoding stage, and traditional vehicle-centric encoding leads to large amounts of repetitive historical trajectory feature encoding, degrading real-time inference performance. To address these challenges, we propose V2X-RECT, a trajectory prediction framework designed for high-density environments. It enhances data association consistency, reduces redundant interactions, and reuses historical information to enable more efficient and accurate prediction. Specifically, we design a multi-source identity matching and correction module that leverages multi-view spatiotemporal relationships to achieve stable and consistent target association, mitigating the adverse effects of mismatches on trajectory encoding and cross-view feature fusion. Then we introduce traffic signal-guided interaction module, encoding trend of traffic light changes as features and exploiting their role in constraining spatiotemporal passage rights to accurately filter key interacting vehicles, while capturing the dynamic impact of signal changes on interaction patterns. Furthermore, a local spatiotemporal coordinate encoding enables reusable features of historical trajectories and map, supporting parallel decoding and significantly improving inference efficiency. Extensive experimental results across V2X-Seq and V2X-Traj datasets demonstrate that our V2X-RECT achieves significant improvements compared to SOTA methods, while also enhancing robustness and inference efficiency across diverse traffic densities.
