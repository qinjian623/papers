## Subfields
 LiDAR 感知 / 场景流估计 / 运动畸变补偿
## Reason for Interest

1. **切入点独特且具有极高的工程价值**：论文敏锐地指出了LiDAR在高速场景（如高速公路自动驾驶卡车）中，除了自车运动导致的畸变外，**他车高速运动**导致的“卷帘快门”畸变（Rolling Shutter Distortion）是现有感知系统的盲点。这对于高等级自动驾驶的安全至关重要。
2. **方法论扎实有效**：提出了HiMo流水线，巧妙地利用场景流（Scene Flow）来计算并校正非自车运动畸变。同时提出了SeFlow++，通过改进动态自标记和对称损失函数，在实时自监督场景流估计中取得了SOTA性能。
3. **实验验证充分且深入**：不仅在公开数据集（Argoverse 2, ZOD）上验证，还采集了针对性的重卡高速多LiDAR数据集（Scania）。
4. **下游任务增益明显**：关键在于，论文证明了该方法作为预处理步骤，能直接提升下游3D检测和语义分割的性能（无需微调模型），证明了其作为通用插件的潜力。
5. **发表于顶刊**：IEEE Transactions on Robotics (T-RO) 录用，代码与评估数据开源，可信度高。
## Abstract: 
LiDAR point cloud is essential for autonomous vehicles, but motion distortions from dynamic objects degrade the data quality. While previous work has considered distortions caused by ego motion, distortions caused by other moving objects remain largely overlooked, leading to errors in object shape and position. This distortion is particularly pronounced in high-speed environments such as highways and in multi-LiDAR configurations, a common setup for heavy vehicles. To address this challenge, we introduce HiMo, a pipeline that repurposes scene flow estimation for non-ego motion compensation, correcting the representation of dynamic objects in point clouds. During the development of HiMo, we observed that existing self-supervised scene flow estimators often produce degenerate or inconsistent estimates under high-speed distortion. We further propose SeFlow++, a real-time scene flow estimator that achieves state-of-the-art performance on both scene flow and motion compensation. Since well-established motion distortion metrics are absent in the literature, we introduce two evaluation metrics: compensation accuracy at a point level and shape similarity of objects. We validate HiMo through extensive experiments on Argoverse 2, ZOD, and a newly collected real-world dataset featuring highway driving and multi-LiDAR-equipped heavy vehicles. Our findings show that HiMo improves the geometric consistency and visual fidelity of dynamic objects in LiDAR point clouds, benefiting downstream tasks such as semantic segmentation and 3D detection.
