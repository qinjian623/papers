## Reason for Interest

The paper presents an incremental improvement to Anchor3DLane using LSTM fusion and standard loss functions (Balanced L1, Chamfer). However, the scientific rigor is low. 

1. **Credibility of Metrics:** The reported baseline F1 score for Anchor3DLane (80.1) is suspiciously high compared to the official published results in CVPR 2023 (~54.3) and other benchmarks on the OpenLane dataset. This suggests a non-standard evaluation protocol, data leakage, or use of a simplified subset, rendering the results incomparable to the field.
2. **Lack of Comparison:** The experiments only compare the proposed method against the authors' own baseline implementation. There are no comparisons with other leading methods (e.g., PersFormer, Gen-LaneNet, GroupLane) to validate true competitiveness.
3. **Depth:** The paper is extremely short (3 pages) with limited qualitative analysis or ablation details.
4. **Innovation:** Replacing Transformer modules with LSTM in 2025 is a regression in architectural complexity without a compelling performance justification beyond 'lightweight', and the added losses are standard techniques in the field.
## Abstract: 
Monocular 3D lane detection remains challenging due to depth ambiguity, occlusion, and temporal instability across frames. Anchor-based approaches such as Anchor3DLane have demonstrated strong performance by regressing continuous 3D lane curves from multi-camera surround views. However, the baseline model still exhibits (i) sensitivity to regression outliers, (ii) weak supervision of global curve geometry, (iii) difficulty in balancing multiple loss terms, and (iv) limited exploitation of temporal continuity. We propose Temporal-Anchor3DLane, an enhanced 3D lane detection framework that extends Anchor3DLane with three key contributions: (1) a set of multi-task loss improvements, including Balanced L1 regression, Chamfer point-set distance, and uncertainty-based loss weighting, together with focal and Dice components for classification and visibility; (2) a lightweight Temporal LSTM Fusion module that aggregates per-anchor features across frames, replacing a heavier Transformer-style temporal fusion; and (3) ESCOP-style training refinements that couple curve-level supervision with temporal consistency. On OpenLane, Temporal-Anchor3DLane improves F1 by +6.2 and yields smoother temporal trajectories, showing that small architectural and loss refinements significantly enhance 3D lane robustness without extra sensors or scaling.
