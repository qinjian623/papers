## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种利用SAM生成边缘掩码的交通标志对抗攻击方法（TSEP-Attack），通过将攻击限制在标志边缘并结合自然纹理先验，有效提升了物理攻击的隐蔽性。方法具有一定的创新性，且在数字域和静态物理实验中验证了有效性。然而，实验主要基于较小规模的TSRD数据集和2D分类任务，未在动态行车环境或包含目标检测/多模态融合的完整自动驾驶感知管线中进行验证，其实际工程威胁度评估略显不足。
## Abstract: 
Intelligent driving systems are vulnerable to physical adversarial attacks on traffic signs. These attacks can cause misclassification, leading to erroneous driving decisions that compromise road safety. Moreover, within V2X networks, such misinterpretations can propagate, inducing cascading failures that disrupt overall traffic flow and system stability. However, a key limitation of current physical attacks is their lack of stealth. Most methods apply perturbations to central regions of the sign, resulting in visually salient patterns that are easily detectable by human observers, thereby limiting their real-world practicality. This study proposes TESP-Attack, a novel stealth-aware adversarial patch method for traffic sign classification. Based on the observation that human visual attention primarily focuses on the central regions of traffic signs, we employ instance segmentation to generate edge-aligned masks that conform to the shape characteristics of the signs. A U-Net generator is utilized to craft adversarial patches, which are then optimized through color and texture constraints along with frequency domain analysis to achieve seamless integration with the background environment, resulting in highly effective visual concealment. The proposed method demonstrates outstanding attack success rates across traffic sign classification models with varied architectures, achieving over 90% under limited query budgets. It also exhibits strong cross-model transferability and maintains robust real-world performance that remains stable under varying angles and distances.
