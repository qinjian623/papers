## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种受声学混响启发的“混响变换（Reverberation Transform）”，从时频域显式建模代理对历史事件的响应延迟（Latencies）。
1. 创新性：将信号处理中的混响概念引入轨迹预测，通过两个可学习的核矩阵（Reverberation Kernel和Generating Kernel）分别解耦了因果延迟模式和随机性变化，视角独特且具有物理可解释性。
2. 性能与SOTA：在行人（ETH-UCY, SDD）和车辆（nuScenes）数据集上均取得了SOTA性能，尤其显著降低了长时预测的终点误差（FDE），证明了建模反应延迟对准确预测未来意图的重要性。
3. 行业价值：该方法在保持高精度的同时，提供了优秀的可解释性（通过可视化延迟曲线分析代理的注意力分布），且推理速度快（Apple M1上单次推理约30ms），模型轻量（约3M参数），适合自动驾驶系统的实时行为预测模块集成。
## Abstract: 
Bridging the past to the future, connecting agents both spatially and temporally, lies at the core of the trajectory prediction task. Despite great efforts, it remains challenging to explicitly learn and predict latencies, the temporal delays with which agents respond to different trajectory-changing events and adjust their future paths, whether on their own or interactively. Different agents may exhibit distinct latency preferences for noticing, processing, and reacting to any specific trajectory-changing event. The lack of consideration of such latencies may undermine the causal continuity of the forecasting system and also lead to implausible or unintended trajectories. Inspired by the reverberation curves in acoustics, we propose a new reverberation transform and the corresponding Reverberation (short for Rev) trajectory prediction model, which simulates and predicts different latency preferences of each agent as well as their stochasticity by using two explicit and learnable reverberation kernels, allowing for the controllable trajectory prediction based on these forecasted latencies. Experiments on multiple datasets, whether pedestrians or vehicles, demonstrate that Rev achieves competitive accuracy while revealing interpretable latency dynamics across agents and scenarios. Qualitative analyses further verify the properties of the proposed reverberation transform, highlighting its potential as a general latency modeling approach.
