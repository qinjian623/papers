## Reason for Interest

该论文价值较低，存在严重缺陷：1. 实验评估极不完整，仅在合成数据集(Virtual KITTI 2)上测试，未在行业通用的真实数据集(如KITTI Depth Completion Benchmark)上验证，无法证明在真实自动驾驶场景下的有效性；2. 对比基线严重过时且不足，仅对比了基础UNet和2022年的SemSegDepth，忽略了该领域近几年主流的SOTA方法(如NLSPN, GuideNet, DySPN等)，其'SOTA'声明缺乏可信度；3. 方法创新性薄弱，利用冻结的YOLO实例掩码进行简单的Cross-Attention融合属于常规工程组合；4. 参考文献和背景描述显得空泛，缺乏对当前技术前沿的深入分析。
## Abstract: 
Depth completion plays a vital role in 3D perception systems, especially in scenarios where sparse depth data must be densified for tasks such as autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. While many existing approaches rely on semantic segmentation to guide depth completion, they often overlook the benefits of object-level understanding. In this work, we introduce an instance-aware depth completion framework that explicitly integrates binary instance masks as spatial priors to refine depth predictions. Our model combines four main components: a frozen YOLO V11 instance segmentation branch, a U-Net-based depth completion backbone, a cross-attention fusion module, and an attention-guided prediction head. The instance segmentation branch generates per-image foreground masks that guide the depth branch via cross-attention, allowing the network to focus on object-centric regions during refinement. We validate our method on the Virtual KITTI 2 dataset, showing that it achieves lower RMSE compared to both a U-Net-only baseline and previous semantic-guided methods, while maintaining competitive MAE. Qualitative and quantitative results demonstrate that the proposed model effectively enhances depth accuracy near object boundaries, occlusions, and thin structures. Our findings suggest that incorporating instance-aware cues offers a promising direction for improving depth completion without relying on dense semantic labels.
