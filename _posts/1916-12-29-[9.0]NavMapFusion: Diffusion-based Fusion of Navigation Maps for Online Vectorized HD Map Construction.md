## Subfields
 在线高精地图构建 (Online HD Map Construction) / 感知与地图融合
## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种极具实用价值的框架NavMapFusion，通过扩散模型将易获取的标精地图（SD Map，如OpenStreetMap）作为先验信息融合到在线高精地图构建中。其核心创新在于利用扩散模型的去噪特性，巧妙地解决了先验地图可能存在的过时、偏差或定位噪声问题，使得模型能够在保留正确先验的同时抑制错误信息。实验结果表明，该方法在长距离感知和遮挡处理上具有显著优势（利用先验补全了传感器盲区），且对地图数据的质量具有较强的鲁棒性。论文不仅在nuScenes上刷新了SOTA，还提供了关于地图错误率、定位误差的详尽消融实验，工程落地潜力大，逻辑严密，结果可信。
## Abstract: 
Accurate environmental representations are essential for autonomous driving, providing the foundation for safe and efficient navigation. Traditionally, high-definition (HD) maps are providing this representation of the static road infrastructure to the autonomous system a priori. However, because the real world is constantly changing, such maps must be constructed online from on-board sensor data. Navigation-grade standard-definition (SD) maps are widely available, but their resolution is insufficient for direct deployment. Instead, they can be used as coarse prior to guide the online map construction process. We propose NavMapFusion, a diffusion-based framework that performs iterative denoising conditioned on high-fidelity sensor data and on low-fidelity navigation maps. This paper strives to answer: (1) How can coarse, potentially outdated navigation maps guide online map construction? (2) What advantages do diffusion models offer for map fusion? We demonstrate that diffusion-based map construction provides a robust framework for map fusion. Our key insight is that discrepancies between the prior map and online perception naturally correspond to noise within the diffusion process; consistent regions reinforce the map construction, whereas outdated segments are suppressed. On the nuScenes benchmark, NavMapFusion conditioned on coarse road lines from OpenStreetMap data reaches a 21.4% relative improvement on 100 m, and even stronger improvements on larger perception ranges, while maintaining real-time capabilities. By fusing low-fidelity priors with high-fidelity sensor data, the proposed method generates accurate and up-to-date environment representations, guiding towards safer and more reliable autonomous driving.
