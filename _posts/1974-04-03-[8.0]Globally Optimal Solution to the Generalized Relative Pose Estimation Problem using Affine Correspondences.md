## Subfields
 Visual Odometry / Multi-Camera SLAM
## Reason for Interest

The paper presents a significant theoretical contribution to geometric perception by proposing the first globally optimal solver for generalized relative pose estimation using affine correspondences and IMU constraints. 

1. **Innovation**: It successfully decouples rotation and translation in the affine constraint formulation and solves it via a polynomial eigenvalue problem, guaranteeing global optimality where previous methods relied on local optimization or minimal solvers.
2. **Performance**: Experimental results on standard autonomous driving benchmarks (KITTI, KITTI-360) demonstrate substantial improvements in accuracy. Notably, the translation direction error is reduced by over 50% in several sequences compared to the recent state-of-the-art global solver (Wu [19]).
3. **Relevance**: The approach is directly applicable to standard sensor suites (Multi-Camera + IMU) used in autonomous vehicles. While the reliance on affine features (like ASIFT) implies a higher computational cost for feature extraction compared to point-based methods, the accuracy gains in the odometry front-end are highly valuable for robust state estimation.
## Abstract: 
Mobile devices equipped with a multi-camera system and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) are widely used nowadays, such as self-driving cars. The task of relative pose estimation using visual and inertial information has important applications in various fields. To improve the accuracy of relative pose estimation of multi-camera systems, we propose a globally optimal solver using affine correspondences to estimate the generalized relative pose with a known vertical direction. First, a cost function about the relative rotation angle is established after decoupling the rotation matrix and translation vector, which minimizes the algebraic error of geometric constraints from affine correspondences. Then, the global optimization problem is converted into two polynomials with two unknowns based on the characteristic equation and its first derivative is zero. Finally, the relative rotation angle can be solved using the polynomial eigenvalue solver, and the translation vector can be obtained from the eigenvector. Besides, a new linear solution is proposed when the relative rotation is small. The proposed solver is evaluated on synthetic data and real-world datasets. The experiment results demonstrate that our method outperforms comparable state-of-the-art methods in accuracy.
