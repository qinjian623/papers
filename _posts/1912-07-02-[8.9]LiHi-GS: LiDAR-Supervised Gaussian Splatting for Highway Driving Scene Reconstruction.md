## Reason for Interest

论文针对自动驾驶中极具挑战性的高速公路场景（特征稀疏、视角受限、长距离感知）提出了 LiHi-GS。其核心价值与创新点在于：
1. **方法创新**：提出了基于 3D Gaussian Splatting 的可微 LiDAR 渲染框架，引入了独立的“LiDAR可见性”参数（解耦了视觉与激光的物理感知差异，如玻璃材质），并设计了相机-LiDAR 解耦位姿优化策略，有效解决了高速运动下的传感器时序对齐问题。
2. **性能优越**：在图像渲染质量和 LiDAR 点云拟合精度上均取得了 SOTA，特别是在长距离（>200m）物体的重建上表现出色。
3. **应用价值**：该技术能够生成高保真的多模态传感器数据（Image + LiDAR），支持场景编辑（如移动车辆），对自动驾驶仿真（Simulation）和数据增强具有极高的工程应用价值。
## Abstract: 
Photorealistic 3D scene reconstruction plays an important role in autonomous driving, enabling the generation of novel data from existing datasets to simulate safety-critical scenarios and expand training data without additional acquisition costs. Gaussian Splatting (GS) facilitates real-time, photorealistic rendering with an explicit 3D Gaussian representation of the scene, providing faster processing and more intuitive scene editing than the implicit Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). While extensive GS research has yielded promising advancements in autonomous driving applications, they overlook two critical aspects: First, existing methods mainly focus on low-speed and feature-rich urban scenes and ignore the fact that highway scenarios play a significant role in autonomous driving. Second, while LiDARs are commonplace in autonomous driving platforms, existing methods learn primarily from images and use LiDAR only for initial estimates or without precise sensor modeling, thus missing out on leveraging the rich depth information LiDAR offers and limiting the ability to synthesize LiDAR data. In this paper, we propose a novel GS method for dynamic scene synthesis and editing with improved scene reconstruction through LiDAR supervision and support for LiDAR rendering. Unlike prior works that are tested mostly on urban datasets, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to focus on the more challenging and highly relevant highway scenes for autonomous driving, with sparse sensor views and monotone backgrounds.
