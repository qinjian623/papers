## Subfields
 Online HD Map Construction / Multi-modal Fusion
## Reason for Interest

The paper demonstrates exceptional performance by effectively utilizing satellite imagery to augment onboard sensors. The proposed Gated Feature Refinement and Geometry-Aware Fusion modules successfully address the common pitfalls of satellite data (noise and misalignment). The fact that it outperforms LiDAR-fused baselines using significantly cheaper satellite data implies immense industrial potential. The experimental validation is rigorous, including robustness tests against weather and localization errors.
