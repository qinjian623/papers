## Reason for Interest

The paper presents a solid engineering optimization for the ICP algorithm, specifically targeting memory efficiency on embedded GPUs (Jetson AGX Xavier), which is relevant for on-board robotics and potential AD applications. The proposed dynamic memory assignment strategy effectively solves the sparsity issue in voxel-based ICP. However, the scoring is strictly capped (<5.0) because the evaluation is conducted entirely on generic/indoor datasets (Stanford Bunny, ModelNet, TUM RGB-D) rather than automotive-grade LiDAR datasets (e.g., KITTI, nuScenes, Waymo). While ICP is a fundamental algorithm for AD localization, the paper focuses on low-level memory optimization without demonstrating validity in large-scale outdoor autonomous driving scenarios.
