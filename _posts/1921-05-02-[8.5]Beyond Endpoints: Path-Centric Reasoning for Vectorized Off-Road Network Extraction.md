## Reason for Interest

论文针对越野自动驾驶场景中非结构化道路提取的难点，提出了具有创新性的Path-centric（以路径为中心）推理框架MaGRoad，有效解决了传统Node-centric方法在遮挡和弱纹理下的连接错误问题。此外，论文构建并开源了大规模越野路网数据集WildRoad，填补了领域空白。实验设计严谨，在自建数据集和公开城市数据集上均验证了方法的有效性和泛化能力，对自动驾驶高精地图构建、特别是特殊场景（如矿区、野外）的地图生产具有较高的研究价值和应用潜力。
## Abstract: 
  This work addresses these limitations in two complementary ways. First, we release WildRoad, a global off-road road network dataset constructed efficiently with a dedicated interactive annotation tool tailored for road-network labeling. Second, we introduce MaGRoad (Mask-aware Geodesic Road network extractor), a path-centric framework that aggregates multi-scale visual evidence along candidate paths to infer connectivity robustly.
  Extensive experiments show that MaGRoad achieves state-of-the-art performance on our challenging WildRoad benchmark while generalizing well to urban datasets. A streamlined pipeline also yields roughly 2.5x faster inference, improving practical applicability. Together, the dataset and path-centric paradigm provide a stronger foundation for mapping roads in the wild.
  We release both the dataset and code at https://github.com/xiaofei-guan/MaGRoad.
