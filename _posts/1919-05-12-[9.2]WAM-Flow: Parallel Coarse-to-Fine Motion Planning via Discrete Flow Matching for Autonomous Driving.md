论文提出了一种基于离散流匹配（Discrete Flow Matching）的 Vision-Language-Action (VLA) 运动规划模型 WAM-Flow，创新性地解决了自回归 VLA 模型推理速度慢的问题，实现了并行生成与由粗到精的轨迹细化。核心创新点包括：1）设计了度量对齐的数值 Tokenizer，解决了离散 Token 难以表达连续几何距离的问题；2）结合了模拟器引导的 GRPO（Group Relative Policy Optimization）强化学习算法，有效提升了闭环驾驶的安全性与舒适性。实验验证充分，在 NAVSIM 和 nuScenes 双榜单上均取得 SOTA，且推理速度相比自回归基线提升显著，具有极高的行业应用潜力。
## Abstract: 
We introduce WAM-Flow, a vision-language-action (VLA) model that casts ego-trajectory planning as discrete flow matching over a structured token space. In contrast to autoregressive decoders, WAM-Flow performs fully parallel, bidirectional denoising, enabling coarse-to-fine refinement with a tunable compute-accuracy trade-off. Specifically, the approach combines a metric-aligned numerical tokenizer that preserves scalar geometry via triplet-margin learning, a geometry-aware flow objective and a simulator-guided GRPO alignment that integrates safety, ego progress, and comfort rewards while retaining parallel generation. A multi-stage adaptation converts a pre-trained auto-regressive backbone (Janus-1.5B) from causal decoding to non-causal flow model and strengthens road-scene competence through continued multimodal pretraining. Thanks to the inherent nature of consistency model training and parallel decoding inference, WAM-Flow achieves superior closed-loop performance against autoregressive and diffusion-based VLA baselines, with 1-step inference attaining 89.1 PDMS and 5-step inference reaching 90.3 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 benchmark. These results establish discrete flow matching as a new promising paradigm for end-to-end autonomous driving. The code will be publicly available soon.
