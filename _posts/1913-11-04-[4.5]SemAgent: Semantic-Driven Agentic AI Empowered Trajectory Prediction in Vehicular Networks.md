## Subfields
 V2X协同轨迹预测 / 语义通信
## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种结合语义通信（Semantic Communication）和Agentic AI（基于LLM的智能体）的V2X轨迹预测框架，利用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) 进行特征压缩，具有较强的跨领域创新性。然而，存在严重缺陷：1. 实验数据集NGSIM过于陈旧（2005年），已不被自动驾驶主流社区视为可靠评测标准（通常使用nuScenes, Waymo等）；2. 缺乏有效的Baseline对比，仅与自身消融版本比较，无法证明其预测性能优于现有的专用轨迹预测模型；3. 核心贡献更偏向通信领域的抗噪传输，而非自动驾驶核心算法的突破。
## Abstract: 
Efficient information exchange and reliable contextual reasoning are essential for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. Conventional communication schemes often incur significant transmission overhead and latency, while existing trajectory prediction models generally lack environmental perception and logical inference capabilities. This paper presents a trajectory prediction framework that integrates semantic communication with Agentic AI to enhance predictive performance in vehicular environments. In vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, a feature-extraction agent at the Roadside Unit (RSU) derives compact representations from historical vehicle trajectories, followed by semantic reasoning performed by a semantic-analysis agent. The RSU then transmits both feature representations and semantic insights to the target vehicle via semantic communication, enabling the vehicle to predict future trajectories by combining received semantics with its own historical data. In vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, each vehicle performs local feature extraction and semantic analysis while receiving predicted trajectories from neighboring vehicles, and jointly utilizes this information for its own trajectory prediction. Extensive experiments across diverse communication conditions demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms baseline schemes, achieving up to a 47.5% improvement in prediction accuracy under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions.
