## Subfields
 端到端自动驾驶 / 世界模型 (World Models)
## Reason for Interest

论文切入点精准，针对当前基于世界模型的端到端自动驾驶（如Dreamer系列）容易过拟合于特定车辆动力学、缺乏泛化能力的问题，提出了显式解耦自车动力学与环境动力学的VDD方法。创新性体现在分层上下文感知的RSSM结构以及针对部署和训练的策略调整（PAD/PAT），这对于解决Sim-to-Real过程中的动力学鸿沟具有重要意义。实验部分扎实，在MetaDrive和CARLA中进行了充分对比，虽然在标准无偏移场景下性能提升不如在鲁棒性测试中显著，但方法论具有较强的物理可解释性和工程参考价值。
## Abstract: 
World models have gained significant attention as a promising approach for autonomous driving. By emulating human-like perception and decision-making processes, these models can predict and adapt to dynamic environments. Existing methods typically map high-dimensional observations into compact latent spaces and learn optimal policies within these latent representations. However, prior work usually jointly learns ego-vehicle dynamics and environmental transition dynamics from the image input, leading to inefficiencies and a lack of robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics. To address these issues, we propose the Vehicle Dynamics embedded Dreamer (VDD) method, which decouples the modeling of ego-vehicle dynamics from environmental transition dynamics. This separation allows the world model to generalize effectively across vehicles with diverse parameters. Additionally, we introduce two strategies to further enhance the robustness of the learned policy: Policy Adjustment during Deployment (PAD) and Policy Augmentation during Training (PAT). Comprehensive experiments in simulated environments demonstrate that the proposed model significantly improves both driving performance and robustness to variations in vehicle dynamics, outperforming existing approaches.
