## Subfields
 Visual Localization / SLAM (视觉重定位)
## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种基于3D视觉大模型（VGGT）的通用视觉重定位框架Reloc-VGGT，核心创新在于提出了稀疏掩码注意力机制（Sparse Mask Attention），将计算复杂度从二次方降低到线性，有效解决了长序列/多视角融合时的计算瓶颈，从而支持大规模场景下的实时重定位。实验表明，该方法在室外自动驾驶数据集（Cambridge Landmarks）及室内数据集上均大幅超越了包括Reloc3R在内的现有SOTA方法。其'实时性'（在序列处理上体现）和基于大模型的泛化能力对自动驾驶中的高精定位与地图构建具有较高的应用价值和行业潜力。
## Abstract: 
Visual localization has traditionally been formulated as a pair-wise pose regression problem. Existing approaches mainly estimate relative poses between two images and employ a late-fusion strategy to obtain absolute pose estimates. However, the late motion average is often insufficient for effectively integrating spatial information, and its accuracy degrades in complex environments. In this paper, we present the first visual localization framework that performs multi-view spatial integration through an early-fusion mechanism, enabling robust operation in both structured and unstructured environments. Our framework is built upon the VGGT backbone, which encodes multi-view 3D geometry, and we introduce a pose tokenizer and projection module to more effectively exploit spatial relationships from multiple database views. Furthermore, we propose a novel sparse mask attention strategy that reduces computational cost by avoiding the quadratic complexity of global attention, thereby enabling real-time performance at scale. Trained on approximately eight million posed image pairs, Reloc-VGGT demonstrates strong accuracy and remarkable generalization ability. Extensive experiments across diverse public datasets consistently validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, delivering high-quality camera pose estimates in real time while maintaining robustness to unseen environments. Our code and models will be publicly released upon acceptance.https://github.com/dtc111111/Reloc-VGGT.
