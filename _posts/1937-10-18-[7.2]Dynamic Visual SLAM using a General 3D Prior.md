## Subfields
 Visual SLAM / Dynamic Scene Understanding
## Reason for Interest

The paper proposes a novel Monocular Visual SLAM system integrating feed-forward reconstruction priors (Pi3MOS) to robustly handle dynamic environments, which is a critical challenge in autonomous driving perception. The method effectively combines learned geometric priors with traditional bundle adjustment. While the innovation and experimental results on dynamic datasets (Bonn, Sintel, Virtual KITTI 2 training) are strong, the evaluation primarily relies on indoor and synthetic datasets rather than large-scale real-world autonomous driving benchmarks (like nuScenes or KITTI Odometry), limiting the direct validation of its 'SOTA' status in vehicle-specific scenarios.
