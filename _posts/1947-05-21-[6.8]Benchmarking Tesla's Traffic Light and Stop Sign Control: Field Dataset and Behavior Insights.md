## Subfields
 ADAS行为建模 / 交通信号交互 (ADAS Behavior Modeling / Traffic Control Interaction)
## Reason for Interest

该论文具有一定的行业参考价值，主要贡献在于填补了商业化ADAS（Tesla Autopilot）与交通信号交互行为数据的空白。创新性体现在提出了针对交通灯/停车牌交互的行为分类学，并发现‘90米’这一车流跟随与停车行为的临界阈值，这对仿真建模和竞品分析有实际意义。然而，作为一篇学术论文，其局限性明显：1）数据集规模较小（仅74个片段，约41公里），相比nuScenes/Waymo等主流数据集缺乏量级；2）采用的FVDM（全速度差模型）属于较为传统的物理驱动模型，缺乏现代深度学习/大模型方法的应用；3）本质上是对现有商业系统的逆向特征分析，而非提出新的自动驾驶核心算法。因此，评分受限于其算法创新性和数据规模。
## Abstract: 
Understanding how Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems (ADAS) interact with Traffic Control Devices (TCDs) is critical for assessing their influence on traffic operations, yet this interaction has received little focused empirical study. This paper presents a field dataset and behavioral analysis of Tesla's Traffic Light and Stop Sign Control (TLSSC), a mature ADAS that perceives traffic lights and stop signs. We design and execute experiments across varied speed limits and TCD types, collecting synchronized high-resolution vehicle trajectory data and driver-perspective video. From these data, we develop a taxonomy of TLSSC-TCD interaction behaviors (i.e., stopping, accelerating, and car following) and calibrate the Full Velocity Difference Model (FVDM) to quantitatively characterize each behavior mode. A novel empirical insight is the identification of a car-following threshold (~90 m). Calibration results reveal that stopping behavior is driven by strong responsiveness to both desired speed deviation and relative speed, whereas accelerating behavior is more conservative. Intersection car-following behavior exhibits smoother dynamics and tighter headways compared to standard car-following behaviors. The established dataset, behavior definitions, and model characterizations together provide a foundation for future simulation, safety evaluation, and design of ADAS-TCD interaction logic. Our dataset is available at GitHub.
