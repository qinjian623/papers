## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种基于文本生成图像（T2I）扩散模型的新型物理对抗攻击框架 DiffSign，针对自动驾驶交通标志识别（TSR）系统。其核心价值在于：1. 创新性地解决了扩散模型生成对抗样本时难以聚焦目标和控制语义的问题，通过裁剪机制、CLIP损失引导和风格定制化（如模拟涂鸦），生成了既具隐蔽性又有强攻击力的物理贴纸。2. 实验验证极为扎实且具有破坏性，不仅在多种主流开源检测器（YOLO全系列, R-CNN系列, DETR）上展示了极强的黑盒迁移能力，更关键的是在真实道路环境下成功攻破了两款知名品牌量产车的TSR系统，并进行了端到端（导致紧急刹车）的风险评估。3. 这种高隐蔽性、高迁移性的物理攻击揭示了当前车端感知系统的严重安全隐患，对于推动防御算法（如多模态校验、时序一致性）的研发具有重要的警示和指导意义。
## Abstract: 
  In this paper, we present DiffSign, a novel T2I-based appearance attack framework designed to generate physically robust, highly effective, transferable, practical, and stealthy appearance attacks against TSR systems. To overcome the limitations of prior approaches, we propose a carefully designed attack pipeline that integrates CLIP-based loss and masked prompts to improve attack focus and controllability. We also propose two novel style customization methods to guide visual appearance and improve out-of-domain traffic sign attack generalization and attack stealthiness. We conduct extensive evaluations of DiffSign under varied real-world conditions, including different distances, angles, light conditions, and sign categories. Our method achieves an average physical-world attack success rate of 83.3%, leveraging DiffSign's high effectiveness in attack transferability.
