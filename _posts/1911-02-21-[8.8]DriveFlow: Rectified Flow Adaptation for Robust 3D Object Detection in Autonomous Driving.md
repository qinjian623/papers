## Reason for Interest

该论文针对自动驾驶长尾天气场景数据稀缺的问题，提出了一种基于Rectified Flow的免训练数据增强方法。其核心创新在于利用频率分解策略（DriveFlow），在保持高频前景（物体3D几何形状）不变的同时，通过低频背景优化实现风格迁移（如改天气），有效解决了传统扩散模型容易破坏3D标签一致性的痛点。实验非常扎实，覆盖了单目、多视角（BEVFormer）及时间序列（BEVDet4D）检测器，并在KITTI-C和nuScenes-C鲁棒性基准上取得了显著优于前沿方法（如DriveGEN）的效果，同时推理速度大幅提升，具有很高的工业落地潜力。
## Abstract: 
In autonomous driving, vision-centric 3D object detection recognizes and localizes 3D objects from RGB images. However, due to high annotation costs and diverse outdoor scenes, training data often fails to cover all possible test scenarios, known as the out-of-distribution (OOD) issue. Training-free image editing offers a promising solution for improving model robustness by training data enhancement without any modifications to pre-trained diffusion models. Nevertheless, inversion-based methods often suffer from limited effectiveness and inherent inaccuracies, while recent rectified-flow-based approaches struggle to preserve objects with accurate 3D geometry. In this paper, we propose DriveFlow, a Rectified Flow Adaptation method for training data enhancement in autonomous driving based on pre-trained Text-to-Image flow models. Based on frequency decomposition, DriveFlow introduces two strategies to adapt noise-free editing paths derived from text-conditioned velocities. 1) High-Frequency Foreground Preservation: DriveFlow incorporates a high-frequency alignment loss for foreground to maintain precise 3D object geometry. 2) Dual-Frequency Background Optimization: DriveFlow also conducts dual-frequency optimization for background, balancing editing flexibility and semantic consistency. Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness and efficiency of DriveFlow, demonstrating comprehensive performance improvements on all categories across OOD scenarios.
