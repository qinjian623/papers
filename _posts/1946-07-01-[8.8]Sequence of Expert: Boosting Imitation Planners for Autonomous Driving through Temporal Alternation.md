## Subfields
 自动驾驶规划 / 模仿学习 (Imitation Learning Planning)
## Reason for Interest

1. 创新性：提出“专家序列(SoE)”方法，利用不同随机种子训练的模型在误差累积上的差异，通过时间轴上的交替推理来打断误差链。这是一种无需修改模型架构、零额外推理耗时的Plug-and-Play策略，视角独特且有效。
2. 实用价值：极高。解决了模仿学习(IL)规划器在闭环测试中因分布偏移导致的“微小误差累积”痛点。相比于昂贵的Diffusion或大模型方案，该方法以极低成本显著提升了传统IL模型的鲁棒性。
3. 实验完整性：在nuPlan大规模数据集上进行了详尽测试，涵盖Val14、Test14及Train14划分，对比了PlanTF、Pluto、DiffusionPlanner等主流基线。提供了关于超参数（切换周期、模型数量）的详细消融研究。
4. 局限性：虽然推理计算量不变，但显存占用随专家数量线性增加；且策略依赖于验证集与测试集分布的一致性来选择最佳模型组合。
## Abstract: 
Imitation learning (IL) has emerged as a central paradigm in autonomous driving. While IL excels in matching expert behavior in open-loop settings by minimizing per-step prediction errors, its performance degrades unexpectedly in closed-loop due to the gradual accumulation of small, often imperceptible errors over time.Over successive planning cycles, these errors compound, potentially resulting in severe failures.Current research efforts predominantly rely on increasingly sophisticated network architectures or high-fidelity training datasets to enhance the robustness of IL planners against error accumulation, focusing on the state-level robustness at a single time point. However, autonomous driving is inherently a continuous-time process, and leveraging the temporal scale to enhance robustness may provide a new perspective for addressing this issue.To this end, we propose a method termed Sequence of Experts (SoE), a temporal alternation policy that enhances closed-loop performance without increasing model size or data requirements. Our experiments on large-scale autonomous driving benchmarks nuPlan demonstrate that SoE method consistently and significantly improves the performance of all the evaluated models, and achieves state-of-the-art performance.This module may provide a key and widely applicable support for improving the training efficiency of autonomous driving models.
