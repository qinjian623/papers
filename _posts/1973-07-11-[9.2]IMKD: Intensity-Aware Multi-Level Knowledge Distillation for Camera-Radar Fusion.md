## Subfields
 多传感器融合 (Camera-Radar) / 3D目标检测 / 知识蒸馏
## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种基于强度的多级知识蒸馏框架（IMKD），创新性地利用激光雷达的反射强度作为“可靠性先验”，指导 Camera-Radar 的特征融合，有效解决了雷达噪声和模态对齐问题。实验结果极其出色，相比之前的蒸馏 SOTA 方法（CRKD）在 NDS 指标上有大幅提升（+8.3%），且在雨天和夜间场景下表现出极强的鲁棒性。此外，方法推理速度达到 25 FPS，具备很高的量产落地潜力。代码已开源，实验设计详实完整。
## Abstract: 
High-performance Radar-Camera 3D object detection can be achieved by leveraging knowledge distillation without using LiDAR at inference time. However, existing distillation methods typically transfer modality-specific features directly to each sensor, which can distort their unique characteristics and degrade their individual strengths. To address this, we introduce IMKD, a radar-camera fusion framework based on multi-level knowledge distillation that preserves each sensor's intrinsic characteristics while amplifying their complementary strengths. IMKD applies a three-stage, intensity-aware distillation strategy to enrich the fused representation across the architecture: (1) LiDAR-to-Radar intensity-aware feature distillation to enhance radar representations with fine-grained structural cues, (2) LiDAR-to-Fused feature intensity-guided distillation to selectively highlight useful geometry and depth information at the fusion level, fostering complementarity between the modalities rather than forcing them to align, and (3) Camera-Radar intensity-guided fusion mechanism that facilitates effective feature alignment and calibration. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes benchmark show that IMKD reaches 67.0% NDS and 61.0% mAP, outperforming all prior distillation-based radar-camera fusion methods.
