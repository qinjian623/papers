## Subfields
 Collaborative Perception (V2X) / 3D Object Detection
## Reason for Interest

该论文提出了一种创新的混合融合架构 CoRA，巧妙地结合了中间融合（Intermediate Fusion）的高性能和后期融合（Late Fusion）对位姿误差的鲁棒性。通过引入竞争性信息传输（CIT）和轻量级协作（LC）模块，有效降低了通信带宽需求并提升了融合效率；通过位姿感知校正（PAC）模块，显著增强了系统在定位噪声下的稳定性。实验验证充分，在 OPV2V 和 DAIR-V2X 双数据集上均达成了 SOTA，特别是在低带宽和高噪声场景下表现出极高的行业应用价值。
## Abstract: 
Collaborative perception has garnered significant attention as a crucial technology to overcome the perceptual limitations of single-agent systems. Many state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods have achieved communication efficiency and high performance via intermediate fusion. However, they share a critical vulnerability: their performance degrades under adverse communication conditions due to the misalignment induced by data transmission, which severely hampers their practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we re-examine different fusion paradigms, and recover that the strengths of intermediate and late fusion are not a trade-off, but a complementary pairing. Based on this key insight, we propose CoRA, a novel collaborative robust architecture with a hybrid approach to decouple performance from robustness with low communication. It is composed of two components: a feature-level fusion branch and an object-level correction branch. Its first branch selects critical features and fuses them efficiently to ensure both performance and scalability. The second branch leverages semantic relevance to correct spatial displacements, guaranteeing resilience against pose errors. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of CoRA. Under extreme scenarios, CoRA improves upon its baseline performance by approximately 19% in AP@0.7 with more than 5x less communication volume, which makes it a promising solution for robust collaborative perception.
