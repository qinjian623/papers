## Subfields
 视觉3D感知 / 语义占据预测 (Semantic Occupancy Prediction)
## Reason for Interest

论文针对基于视觉的3D占据预测中'占据状态误判导致特征丢失'这一核心痛点，提出了基于深度的软占据置信度（Soft Occupancy Confidence）机制，替代了传统的硬阈值截断，有效保留了潜在的物体特征。同时，引入预训练的2D语义分割信息构建语义辅助体素，显著增强了类别预测的鲁棒性。实验设计非常完整，在三个主流数据集上进行了验证，且在SemanticKITTI上取得了大幅度的性能提升（+2.14 mIoU），消融实验逻辑清晰，证明了各模块的有效性。尽管在部分数据集上略低于SOTA，但整体方法论创新性强，工程价值高。
## Abstract: 
Camera-based 3D semantic occupancy prediction offers an efficient and cost-effective solution for perceiving surrounding scenes in autonomous driving. However, existing works rely on explicit occupancy state inference, leading to numerous incorrect feature assignments, and insufficient samples restrict the learning of occupancy class inference. To address these challenges, we propose leveraging \textbf{D}epth awareness and \textbf{S}emantic aid to boost camera-based 3D semantic \textbf{Occ}upancy prediction (\textbf{DSOcc}). We jointly perform occupancy state and occupancy class inference, where soft occupancy confidence is calculated by non-learning method and multiplied with image features to make voxels aware of depth, enabling adaptive implicit occupancy state inference. Instead of enhancing feature learning, we directly utilize well-trained image semantic segmentation and fuse multiple frames with their occupancy probabilities to aid occupancy class inference, thereby enhancing robustness. Experimental results demonstrate that DSOcc achieves state-of-the-art performance on the SemanticKITTI dataset among camera-based methods and achieves competitive performance on the SSCBench-KITTI-360 and Occ3D-nuScenes datasets. Code will be released on github.
