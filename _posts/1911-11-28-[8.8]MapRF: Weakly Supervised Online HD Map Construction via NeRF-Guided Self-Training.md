## Reason for Interest

论文提出了一种利用2D图像标签进行3D高精地图构建的弱监督框架MapRF，直击3D标注成本高昂的行业痛点。其核心创新在于设计了Map-Conditioned NeRF (MC-NeRF) 模块，利用神经辐射场的多视角一致性将有噪声的2D投影（IPM）转化为高质量的3D伪标签，并通过自训练和射线匹配（Map-to-Ray Matching）策略有效提升了地图元素的几何准确性。实验在Argoverse 2和nuScenes上验证了其大幅超越现有的弱监督方法，甚至在nuScenes上超越了早期的全监督方法（如VectorMapNet），具有很高的学术价值和落地潜力。
## Abstract: 
Autonomous driving systems benefit from high-definition (HD) maps that provide critical information about road infrastructure. The online construction of HD maps offers a scalable approach to generate local maps from on-board sensors. However, existing methods typically rely on costly 3D map annotations for training, which limits their generalization and scalability across diverse driving environments. In this work, we propose MapRF, a weakly supervised framework that learns to construct 3D maps using only 2D image labels. To generate high-quality pseudo labels, we introduce a novel Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) module conditioned on map predictions, which reconstructs view-consistent 3D geometry and semantics. These pseudo labels are then iteratively used to refine the map network in a self-training manner, enabling progressive improvement without additional supervision. Furthermore, to mitigate error accumulation during self-training, we propose a Map-to-Ray Matching strategy that aligns map predictions with camera rays derived from 2D labels. Extensive experiments on the Argoverse 2 and nuScenes datasets demonstrate that MapRF achieves performance comparable to fully supervised methods, attaining around 75% of the baseline while surpassing several approaches using only 2D labels. This highlights the potential of MapRF to enable scalable and cost-effective online HD map construction for autonomous driving.
