## Reason for Interest

论文针对自动驾驶中基于高斯泼溅（Gaussian Splatting）的占据栅格预测计算量大、难以实时的问题，提出使用超二次曲面（Superquadrics）作为稀疏场景表征。创新点在于设计了‘多层高斯近似’模块，将不可微的超二次曲面转换为可微的高斯分布进行渲染监督，从而实现了自监督训练。实验证明该方法大幅减少了图元数量（减少84%），实现了实时推理（21.5 FPS），且在动态物体（如车辆、行人）的分割精度上优于纯高斯方法。尽管在道路等大面积静态背景上的IoU有所下降，但其在效率与前景物体感知上的平衡对车端部署具有极高价值。
## Abstract: 
Semantic occupancy estimation enables comprehensive scene understanding for automated driving, providing dense spatial and semantic information essential for perception and planning. While Gaussian representations have been widely adopted in self-supervised occupancy estimation, the deployment of a large number of Gaussian primitives drastically increases memory requirements and is not suitable for real-time inference. In contrast, superquadrics permit reduced primitive count and lower memory requirements due to their diverse shape set. However, implementation into a self-supervised occupancy model is nontrivial due to the absence of a superquadric rasterizer to enable model supervision. Our proposed method, SuperQuadricOcc, employs a superquadric-based scene representation. By leveraging a multi-layer icosphere-tessellated Gaussian approximation of superquadrics, we enable Gaussian rasterization for supervision during training. On the Occ3D dataset, SuperQuadricOcc achieves a 75\% reduction in memory footprint, 124\% faster inference, and a 5.9\% improvement in mIoU compared to previous Gaussian-based methods, without the use of temporal labels. To our knowledge, this is the first occupancy model to enable real-time inference while maintaining competitive performance. The use of superquadrics reduces the number of primitives required for scene modeling by 84\% relative to Gaussian-based approaches. Finally, evaluation against prior methods is facilitated by our fast superquadric voxelization module. The code will be released as open source.
