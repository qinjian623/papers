 GNSS / INS 融合定位与状态初始化
## Reason for Interest

论文针对GNSS-INS系统的状态初始化难题，提出了一种基于历元间基线残差（Inter-Epoch Baseline Residuals）的两阶段优化方法。其核心创新在于通过可观测性分析（基于Hessian矩阵奇异值比率）自动判断何时从相对约束切换到绝对全局约束，有效避免了初始阶段噪声导致的局部极小值问题。论文提供了扎实的可观测性理论推导，并在多个公开数据集（包含无人机和地面车辆场景）上验证了其相比传统EKF和优化方法（RA-JAPE）在鲁棒性和精度上的提升，具有较高的工程实用价值和理论深度。
## Abstract: 
Initializing the state of a sensorized platform can be challenging, as a limited set of measurements often provide low-informative constraints that are in addition highly non-linear. This may lead to poor initial estimates that may converge to local minima during subsequent non-linear optimization. We propose an adaptive GNSS-inertial initialization strategy that delays the incorporation of global GNSS constraints until they become sufficiently informative. In the initial stage, our method leverages inter-epoch baseline vector residuals between consecutive GNSS fixes to mitigate inertial drift. To determine when to activate global constraints, we introduce a general criterion based on the evolution of the Hessian matrix's singular values, effectively quantifying system observability. Experiments on EuRoC, GVINS and MARS-LVIG datasets show that our approach consistently outperforms the naive strategy of fusing all measurements from the outset, yielding more accurate and robust initializations.
