论文在经典的基于状态格（State Lattice）的路径规划基础上，提出了一种创新的MeshA*算法。通过构建'扩展网格单元'（Extended Cell）将运动基元映射到网格上，算法成功结合了网格搜索的高效剪枝能力与运动规划的动力学约束。这种方法在不损失最优性的情况下显著降低了计算量（加速1.5-2倍），对于自动驾驶中的泊车规划、低速复杂场景规划等对实时性要求高的模块具有重要的工程应用价值。论文理论证明完备，实验对比充分且代码开源。
## Abstract: 
We study a path planning problem where the possible move actions are represented as a finite set of motion primitives aligned with the grid representation of the environment. That is, each primitive corresponds to a short kinodynamically-feasible motion of an agent and is represented as a sequence of the swept cells of a grid. Typically, heuristic search, i.e. A*, is conducted over the lattice induced by these primitives (lattice-based planning) to find a path. However, due to the large branching factor, such search may be inefficient in practice. To this end, we suggest a novel technique rooted in the idea of searching over the grid cells (as in vanilla A*) simultaneously fitting the possible sequences of the motion primitives into these cells. The resultant algorithm, MeshA*, provably preserves the guarantees on completeness and optimality, on the one hand, and is shown to notably outperform conventional lattice-based planning (x1.5-x2 decrease in the runtime), on the other hand.
