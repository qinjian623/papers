 端到端自动驾驶 / 模仿学习 / 仿真数据生成
## Reason for Interest

这是一篇高质量的端到端自动驾驶研究。论文敏锐地指出了模仿学习中长期被忽视的问题——‘专家-学生不对称性’（感知可见性、状态不确定性、导航意图），并提出了一套系统性的解决方案（LEAD 专家与 TFv6 模型）。创新性在于不再单纯‘卷’模型结构，而是优化监督信号的质量。实验极其扎实，不仅在 CARLA 多个高难度闭环榜单上刷新 SOTA，还通过 Sim-to-Real 实验证明了基于 LEAD 的合成数据预训练能显著提升真实世界基准（NAVSIM, Waymo）的性能。对行业从数据侧提升端到端模型能力具有极高的参考价值。
## Abstract: 
Simulators can generate virtually unlimited driving data, yet imitation learning policies in simulation still struggle to achieve robust closed-loop performance. Motivated by this gap, we empirically study how misalignment between privileged expert demonstrations and sensor-based student observations can limit the effectiveness of imitation learning. More precisely, experts have significantly higher visibility (e.g., ignoring occlusions) and far lower uncertainty (e.g., knowing other vehicles' actions), making them difficult to imitate reliably. Furthermore, navigational intent (i.e., the route to follow) is under-specified in student models at test time via only a single target point. We demonstrate that these asymmetries can measurably limit driving performance in CARLA and offer practical interventions to address them. After careful modifications to narrow the gaps between expert and student, our TransFuser v6 (TFv6) student policy achieves a new state of the art on all major publicly available CARLA closed-loop benchmarks, reaching 95 DS on Bench2Drive and more than doubling prior performances on Longest6~v2 and Town13. Additionally, by integrating perception supervision from our dataset into a shared sim-to-real pipeline, we show consistent gains on the NAVSIM and Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End driving benchmarks.
